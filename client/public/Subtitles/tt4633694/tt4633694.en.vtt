<i>All right,
let's do this one last time.</i>

3
00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:22.481
<i>My name is Peter Parker.</i>

4
00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.784
<i>I was bitten
by a radioactive spider.</i>

5
00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:27.587
<i>And for 10 years...</i>

6
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.820
<i>I've been the one</i>

7
00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:30.555
<i>and only</i>

8
00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:31.858
<i>Spider-Man.</i>

9
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.593
<i>I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.</i>

10
00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.762
With great power comes
great responsibility.

11
00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:41.234
<i>I saved a bunch of people,
fell in love, saved the city.</i>

12
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.170
<i>And then I saved the city again.</i>

13
00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.304
<i>And again and again</i>

14
00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:46.606
<i>and again.</i>

15
00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:47.606
<i>And I did, uh...</i>

16
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.207
<i>I did this.</i>

<i>Look, I'm a comic book.
I'm a cereal.</i>

21
00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:58.617
<i>Did a Christmas album.</i>

22
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.286

25
00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:07.293
<i>I mean, I've looked worse.</i>

26
00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:09.662
<i>But after everything...</i>

27
00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.197
<i>I still love being Spider-Man.</i>

28
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.566
<i>I mean, who wouldn't?</i>

29
00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:15.667
<i>So no matter
how many hits I take...</i>

30
00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:21.640
<i>...I always find a way
to come back.</i>

31
00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:25.478
<i>Because the only thing standing
between this city and oblivion</i>

<i>is me.</i>

33
00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:29.549
<i>There's only one Spider-Man.</i>

34
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.817

44
00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:00.562
Miles!

45
00:03:00.563 --> 00:03:01.580
Yeah! Yeah?

46
00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.915
Are you finished packing
for school?

47
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.318
Yeah.

48
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:08.920
Just ironing my last shirt.

<i>� You're a sunflower... �</i>

Come on! You a grown man now.

51
00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.328
- Let's show these teachers that.
- Miles!

52
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.597
Where's my laptop?

53
00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.832
If you want me to drive you,
we gotta go now.

54
00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.368
No, Dad, I'll walk.

55
00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.403
- Personal chauffeur going once.
- It's okay.

56
00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:26.755
Miles! Gotta go.

57
00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:27.772
In a minute!

58
00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:28.741
Gotta go.

59
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:29.675
In a minute!

60
00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:31.409
Mom, I gotta go.

61
00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:32.612
In a minute.

62
00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:38.950
See you Friday.

63
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.789
Look who's back.
Yo, what's going on, bro?

64
00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:46.859
Hey, I'm just walking
by. How you doin'?

65
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.795
Yo, Miles! You feel
that earthquake last night?

66
00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.866
What you talkin' about?
I slept like a baby last night.

67
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:54.834
How's that new school?

68
00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:55.768
So easy.

69
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.419
We miss you, Miles.

70
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.037
You miss me? I still live here!

71
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.274
Wait, you miss me?

72
00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.515
<i>Contra!</i>

73
00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.019
Oh, come on.

74
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.989
Seriously, Dad.
Walking would've been fine.

75
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:18.591
You can walk plenty on Saturday

76
00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:19.866
when you peel
those stickers off.

77
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:21.927
You saw that?
I don't know if that was me.

78
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.928
And the two from yesterday
on Clinton.

79
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:26.464
Yeah, those were me.

80
00:04:26.497 --> 00:04:29.668
Look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

81
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:30.536
You see that?

82
00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:31.370
Totally. Yeah.

83
00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:32.355
What's that one called?

84
00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:33.306
Foam Party.

85
00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:36.041
"Foam Party"? Come on.

86
00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:38.411
And everyone is just linin' up.
You see that?

87
00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.578
I see it.

88
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.079
Is that a coffee shop
or a disco?

89
00:04:41.112 --> 00:04:42.781
Dad, you're old, man.

90
00:04:42.814 --> 00:04:44.582
<i>There are multiple reports</i>

91
00:04:44.615 --> 00:04:46.485
<i>of another mysterious
seismic event last night.</i>

92
00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:48.462
<i>Sources close to Spider-Man say
he's looking into the problem.</i>

93
00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.924
Spider-Man. I mean,
this guy swings in once a day,

94
00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:54.360
zip-zap-zop in his little mask
and answers to no one. Right?

95
00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:55.527
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

96
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.028
Meanwhile,
my guys are out there,

97
00:04:57.062 --> 00:04:58.264
lives on the line, no masks.

98
00:04:58.265 --> 00:04:59.465
Uh-huh.

99
00:04:59.497 --> 00:05:00.966
We show our faces.

100
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.435
Speed up. I know these kids.

101
00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.437
With great ability comes
great accountability.

102
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.038
That's not even
how the saying goes.

103
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.574
I do like his cereal, though.
I'll give him that.

104
00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:10.843
Oh, my gosh.
Don't cops run red lights?

105
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.677
Oh, yeah, some do.
But not your dad.

Why can't I go back
to Brooklyn Middle?

110
00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:28.094
You've given it two weeks.

111
00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.862
We're not having
this conversation.

112
00:05:29.894 --> 00:05:32.063
I just think that
this new school is elitist.

113
00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:33.665
- "Elitist"?
- And I would prefer to be

114
00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.468
At a normal school
among the people.

115
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.402
"The people"?
These are your people.

116
00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:39.838
I'm only here 'cause
I won that stupid lottery.

117
00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.574
No way. You passed the entry
test just like everybody else.

118
00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:45.144
You have an opportunity here.
You wanna blow that?

119
00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:46.846
You wanna end up
like your uncle?

120
00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.915
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron?
He's a good guy.

121
00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:51.483
We all make choices in life.

122
00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:53.025
It doesn't feel
like I have a choice right now.

123
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.486
You don't!

124
00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.033
I love you, Miles.

125
00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:11.971
Yeah, I know, Dad.
See you Friday.

126
00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:17.226
You gotta say "I love you" back.

127
00:06:17.227 --> 00:06:18.677
Dad, are you serious?

128
00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:19.820
I wanna hear it.
"I love you, Dad."

129
00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:21.480
You wanna hear me say it?

130
00:06:21.512 --> 00:06:22.855
You're dropping me off
at a school.

131
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.056
- "I love you, Dad."
- Look at this place.

132
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.050
"Dad, I love you."

133
00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:29.789
Dad, I love you.

"I love you, Dad."

Hey, good morning.
How you doin'?

138
00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:42.917
Weekend was short, huh?

139
00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:44.135
"That's a copy."

140
00:06:44.168 --> 00:06:46.504
Oh, my gosh!
This is embarrassing.

141
00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:48.206
We wore the same jacket.

142
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.509
Hey. Your shoe's untied.

143
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:53.545
Yeah, I'm aware.

Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark.
You're late again.

Einstein said
time was relative, right?

157

Maybe I'm not late.
Maybe you guys are early.

158
00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:43.762
Sorry.
It was just so quiet.

159
00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:46.064
Would you like to keep
standing there,

160
00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.133

163
00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:57.909
<i>Thanks to everyone here at
the Fisk Family Foundation...</i>

164
00:07:57.942 --> 00:07:59.027
I liked your joke.

165
00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:00.111
Really?

166
00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:03.515
I mean, it wasn't funny.
That's why I laughed.

167
00:08:03.548 --> 00:08:05.750
But it was smart, so I liked it.

168
00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:07.286
I don't think

169
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.987
I've seen you before.

170
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.689

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:16.562
<i>A what-if to infinity.</i>

173
00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:20.099
A zero?
A few more of those,

174
00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.701
you'd probably have
to kick me outta here, huh?

175
00:08:24.168 --> 00:08:26.038
Maybe I'm just not right
for this school.

176
00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:28.140
If a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers

177
00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:29.942
on a true-or-false quiz
at random,

178
00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:31.844
do you know
what score they would get?

179
00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:32.811
50%?

180
00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:33.745
That's right!

181
00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:35.880
The only way to get
all the answers wrong

182
00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:38.182
is to know
which answers are right.

183
00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:40.818
You're trying to quit.

184
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:43.288
And I'm not gonna let you.

185
00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.591
I'm assigning you
a personal essay.

Uncle Aaron!
Hey! Were you scared?

199
00:09:35.072 --> 00:09:38.043
You want that?

200
00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:39.378
What's up with school?

201
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.679
Going great!
Got tons of friends.

202
00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:43.848
You can't tell me
it's all that bad there.

203
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:45.250
Smart girls is where it's at.

204
00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:46.719
Place must be full of 'em.

205
00:09:49.187 --> 00:09:50.322
No, there's no one.

206
00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:52.057
Yo, I can't have
no nephew of mine

207
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.359
on the streets with no game.

208
00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.628
Hey, I got game.
There's a new girl.

209
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.296
Actually, you know,
she's kinda into me.

210
00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.365
You know how it is.

211
00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.634
What's her name?

212
00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.870
You know, we layin' down
the groundwork right now.

213
00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:07.406
You know about
the shoulder touch?

214
00:10:07.438 --> 00:10:09.307
'Course I do.

215
00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.110
But tell me anyway.

216
00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.913
Tomorrow, find that girl.
You walk up to her and be like:

217
00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:18.850
"Hey."

218
00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.219
You serious, Uncle Aaron?

219
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:22.221
I'm tellin' you, man,
it's science.

220
00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:25.090
So walk up to her
and be like: "Hey."

221
00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:28.193
No, no, no, no.
"Hey."

222
00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:29.360
"Hey."

223
00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:32.096
No. "Hey."

224
00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:33.731
"Hey."

225
00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:37.670
You sure you my nephew, man?

226
00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:39.170
Is that her?

227
00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:42.740
I should probably go.
Still got a paper to do tonight.

228
00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:45.943
Yo, you been holdin' out on me?
You throw these up yet?

229
00:10:45.976 --> 00:10:48.947
Naw, man. You know
my dad. I can't.

230
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.149
Come on. I got a spot
you ain't gon' believe.

231
00:10:51.182 --> 00:10:53.351
Naw, I can't.
I can't. Can't.

232
00:10:55.253 --> 00:10:56.955
I'm gonna get
in so much trouble.

233
00:10:56.988 --> 00:11:00.859
Hey, man. Tell him
your art teacher made you.

234
00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:03.128
How'd you know about this place?

235
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.296
Did an engineering job
down here.

236

<i>� One, two, three

238
00:11:22.913 --> 00:11:24.683
Yeah, man,
I knew we were related.

239
00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:27.386
Whoa!

240

Brooklyn!

241
00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:35.695
There's a lot of history
on these walls.

242
00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:38.798
This is so fresh.

243
00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:48.374
And now you on your own, Miles.

244
00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:52.477
Whoa, slow down a little.

245
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.346
That's better.

246

but if you don't,
you gotta keep it moving.

261

That's intentional.

262
00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:42.278
Wow.

263

No, man.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.399
Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing there.

266
00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:49.567
Yeah. You know,

267
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.171
me and your dad used
to do this back in the day.

268

Stop lyin'.

269
00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:54.372
It's true.

270

All right, come on, man.

What?

281
00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:28.750
Oh! Are you okay?

282
00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:30.235
What?

Why are you so sweaty?

It's a puberty thing.

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:38.677
I don't know why I said that.
I'm not going through puberty.

287
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.381
I did, but I'm done.

right? We got that in common.

290

Yeah. That's one thing.

291

Cool. Yeah. I'm Miles.

00:14:57.428 --> 00:15:01.033
Yes, it's African.
I'm South African.

295
00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:04.168
No accent though
'cause I was raised here.

No "G." That's crazy. Heh.

Hey.

Okay, then.

302
00:15:27.524 --> 00:15:28.693
I'll see you around.

303

Oh. See you.

00:15:32.062 --> 00:15:33.048
Sorry. Um...

Hey.

306

Oh, crap.

307
00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:38.103

Workin' on it.

312
00:15:45.043 --> 00:15:46.745
It's just puberty.

313
00:15:46.778 --> 00:15:50.414
I don't think you know
what puberty is. Just relax.

314
00:15:50.447 --> 00:15:51.265
Okay, I have a plan.

315
00:15:51.266 --> 00:15:52.083
Great.

316
00:15:52.116 --> 00:15:53.701
I'm gonna pull really hard.

317
00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:55.286
That's a terrible plan.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.421
- One.
- Don't do this.

319
00:15:56.453 --> 00:15:57.021
Two.

320
00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:57.588
Three!

321
00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.764
Nice to meet you?

322
00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:09.999
Sure. Total pleasure.

323
00:16:14.672 --> 00:16:17.743
<i>No one saw. It's okay.</i>

324
00:16:17.775 --> 00:16:20.644
<i>No one knows, no one knows.</i>

325
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.349
<i>Everyone knows.</i>

326
00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:28.186
<i>Everyone knows.
They're talkin' 'bout me.</i>

327
00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:29.221
<i>They saw everything!</i>

328
00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.023
<i>He knows. She knows. They know.</i>

329
00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.456
<i>Wow, she's super tall.</i>

330
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.525
<i>Why is he smiling?
Am I the weird guy now?</i>

331
00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:35.526
<i>What am I doing?</i>

332
00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:36.727
That guy's such a weirdo.

333
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.462
<i>How do I stop?</i>

334
00:16:38.495 --> 00:16:40.298
<i>Can they hear my thoughts?!</i>

335
00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:43.067
<i>Why are all my thoughts
so loud?!</i>

336
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.736
Hey! I know you snuck out
last night, Morales.

337
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:47.304
<i>Play dumb!</i>

338
00:16:47.337 --> 00:16:48.639
Who's Morales?

339
00:16:48.673 --> 00:16:50.509
<i>Not that dumb!</i>

340
00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:52.110
Hey!

341
00:16:58.682 --> 00:17:00.718
<i>Okay, okay. You're okay.</i>

342
00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:02.319
<i>You're okay.</i>

343
00:17:02.352 --> 00:17:04.188
<i>He'll never find you.</i>

344
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.523
<i>No.</i>

345
00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:12.363
Ow!

346
00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:14.698
What are you doing
in my office, Morales?!

347
00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:17.501
Morales! Open up!

348
00:17:17.535 --> 00:17:19.237
<i>� Oh, Spider-bells
Goblin smells �</i>

349
00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:21.539
Why is this happening?

350
00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.442
<i>� Spider-buggy blew a tire �</i>

351
00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:25.276
He's got a nice voice.

352
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:27.078
<i>� Spidey-bells, Spidey-bells �</i>

353
00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.480
Open up!

354
00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:31.383
Stop sticking!

355
00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:36.555
Keep sticking, Miles! Oh!

356
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.133
Hofstadter is suggesting...

357
00:17:49.433 --> 00:17:50.668
...is that we...

358
00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:53.238
...look on the...

359
00:17:59.243 --> 00:18:00.544
Okay.

360
00:18:04.582 --> 00:18:06.185
My room!

361
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:12.723
<i>"Why is this happening?"</i>

362
00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:16.195
<i>"Please stop sticking."</i>

363
00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.397
<i>"Please keep st..."</i>

364
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.632
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

365
00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:22.334
How could there be
two Spider-Men?

366
00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:24.269
There can't be two Spider-Men.

367
00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:26.805
<i>Can there?</i>

368
00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:32.277
<i>Come on, Uncle Aaron,
pick up. Pick up!</i>

369
00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:34.245
<i>Yo, it's Aaron.</i>

370
00:18:34.278 --> 00:18:35.646
<i>I'm outta town for a few days.</i>

371
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.789
<i>I'll hit you when I'm back.
Peace.</i>

372
00:18:36.814 --> 00:18:38.216
<i>No. No-No-No-No-No.</i>

373
00:18:38.249 --> 00:18:40.485
<i>It's not possible!</i>

374
00:18:40.518 --> 00:18:42.354
<i>It's just puberty.</i>

375
00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:45.222
<i>It's a normal spider
and I'm a normal kid!</i>

376
00:18:47.892 --> 00:18:49.695
All right!

377
00:18:53.798 --> 00:18:55.901
<i>I gotta tell someone.</i>

378
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.594
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.

379
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.865
Find the spider.

380
00:19:27.898 --> 00:19:29.500
You'll see.

381
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:45.683
It's a normal spider.

382
00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:50.889
It's, like, boring
how normal this spider is.

383
00:19:59.864 --> 00:20:01.633
<i>I'm right here.</i>

384
00:20:01.665 --> 00:20:03.935
<i>Why is this happening to me?</i>

385
00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:12.644
<i>Slow down! What am I doing?</i>

386
00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:19.750
<i>Way over there.</i>

387
00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:20.919
<i>You're like me.</i>

388
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:22.753
<i>Miles. Look out.</i>

389
00:20:22.787 --> 00:20:24.456
<i>I don't wanna be a hero.</i>

390
00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.557
<i>Miles.</i>

391
00:20:27.625 --> 00:20:28.559
Whoa!

392
00:20:31.929 --> 00:20:34.699
Norman, listen to me.

393
00:20:34.731 --> 00:20:36.433
<i>Spider-Man?</i>

394
00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:39.371
I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.

395
00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:41.506
Brooklyn is not zoned for that.

396
00:20:42.773 --> 00:20:44.608
It's not up to me.

397
00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:46.344
<i>Is that Green Goblin?!</i>

398
00:20:46.376 --> 00:20:47.878
Why won't you quit?!

399
00:20:47.912 --> 00:20:50.815
I guess I like Brooklyn not
being sucked into a black hole.

400
00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:52.517
I think I'm gonna go.

401
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:54.485
- Staten Island, maybe.
- Not Brooklyn.

402
00:20:59.757 --> 00:21:01.593
No! No!

403
00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:24.950
Whoa!

404
00:21:26.483 --> 00:21:28.319
What now?

405
00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:29.788
What is this place?

406
00:21:56.513 --> 00:21:58.616
Did you know your shoes
are untied?

407
00:21:59.717 --> 00:22:00.719
Uh-huh.

408
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.720
This is a onesie,

409
00:22:01.752 --> 00:22:03.688
so I don't really
have to worry about it.

410
00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:12.697
I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.

411
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.132
I don't wanna be.

412
00:22:14.164 --> 00:22:17.034
I don't think
you have a choice, kiddo.

413
00:22:17.067 --> 00:22:19.604
Got a lot going through
your head, I'm sure.

414
00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:20.904
Yeah.

415
00:22:20.938 --> 00:22:23.441
You're gonna be fine.
I can help you.

416
00:22:23.473 --> 00:22:25.809
If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.

417
00:22:25.843 --> 00:22:28.146
Yeah.

418
00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:31.483
I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick

419
00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.551
before the space-time
continuum collapses.

420
00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:34.553
Don't move.

421
00:22:37.587 --> 00:22:39.124
See you in a bit.

422
00:22:49.834 --> 00:22:51.536
<i>How does he do that?</i>

423
00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:57.041
Is it here?
No, no, it's here.

424
00:22:57.074 --> 00:22:59.477
All right, folks.

425
00:22:59.509 --> 00:23:00.644
I always get this wrong.

426
00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:03.048
Oh, boy.

427
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.015
Prowler.

428
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.920
Man, I was in
the middle of something.

429
00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:15.093
I am so tired.

430
00:23:18.729 --> 00:23:20.966
Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.

431
00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:29.641
That all you got?

432
00:23:31.875 --> 00:23:33.711
Aw, so gross.

433
00:23:33.743 --> 00:23:36.847
<i>I should go up there
and help him.</i>

434
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:39.617
<i>Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.</i>

435
00:23:45.155 --> 00:23:49.092
Watch out. Here comes
the Spider-Man.

436
00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:51.095
You like my new toy?

437
00:23:51.127 --> 00:23:55.532
Cost me a fortune, but, hey,
can't take it with you, right?

438
00:23:55.566 --> 00:23:58.803
You came all this way.
Watch the test.

439
00:23:58.836 --> 00:24:00.245
It's a hell of a freaking
light show.

440
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.205
You're gonna love this.

441
00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:08.079
No! No,
don't do this! Stop!

442
00:24:08.112 --> 00:24:11.548
You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!

443
00:24:26.163 --> 00:24:29.067
I see multiple dimensions
opening!

444
00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:34.038
That was three, four
and five separate dimensions.

445
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.073
It's unstable! We should stop.

446
00:24:48.786 --> 00:24:51.056
Norm, what's your take
on head trauma?

447
00:24:54.858 --> 00:24:56.894
I tried to warn you, pal.

448
00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:12.744
Goblin, no!
Get him outta there!

449
00:25:19.016 --> 00:25:20.852
<i>Wilson! Where are we?</i>

450
00:25:22.752 --> 00:25:24.588
<i>Really weird.</i>

451
00:25:24.622 --> 00:25:25.990
<i>Wilson!</i>

452
00:25:59.356 --> 00:26:01.960
Hey! Are you okay?

453
00:26:01.992 --> 00:26:04.028
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm just resting.

454
00:26:05.762 --> 00:26:06.713
Can't you get up?

455
00:26:06.714 --> 00:26:07.664
Yeah.

456
00:26:07.698 --> 00:26:09.867
Yeah, I always get up.

457
00:26:11.368 --> 00:26:13.704
The coughing's
probably not a good sign.

458
00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:15.740
Find him. Now.

459
00:26:15.772 --> 00:26:19.042
Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.

460
00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:21.913
This override key is the only
way to stop the collider.

461
00:26:21.945 --> 00:26:25.616
Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.

462
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.951
You need to hide your face.

463
00:26:26.983 --> 00:26:29.186
You don't tell anyone
who you are.

464
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.256
No one can know. He's got
everyone in his pocket.

465
00:26:32.288 --> 00:26:34.125
If he turns
the machine on again,

466
00:26:34.157 --> 00:26:36.059
everything you know
will disappear.

467
00:26:36.093 --> 00:26:37.996
Your family, everyone.

468
00:26:38.028 --> 00:26:40.397
Everyone.

469
00:26:40.431 --> 00:26:42.834
Promise me you'll do this.

470
00:26:47.203 --> 00:26:48.673
I promise.

471
00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:51.642
Go. Destroy the collider.

472
00:26:51.675 --> 00:26:53.110
I'll come and find you.

473
00:26:54.878 --> 00:26:56.046
It's gonna be okay.

474
00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:05.823
Tombstone.

475
00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:07.057
We're done with tests.

476
00:27:08.826 --> 00:27:11.996
Get that thing ready
to go again. And soon.

477
00:27:12.028 --> 00:27:13.964
Run faster!

478
00:27:13.998 --> 00:27:15.700
These guys are weak.

479
00:27:15.732 --> 00:27:18.435
I'd say it's nice
to see you again, Spider-Man,

480
00:27:18.469 --> 00:27:19.804
but it's not.

481
00:27:19.836 --> 00:27:21.305
Hey, Kingpin.
How's business?

482
00:27:21.337 --> 00:27:22.906
Boomin'. Heh.

483
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.244
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

484
00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.846
This might open a black hole
under Brooklyn.

485
00:27:28.878 --> 00:27:31.281
It can't be worth the risk.

486
00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:34.152
It's not always
about the money, Spider-Man.

487
00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.959
Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?

488
00:27:41.991 --> 00:27:43.060
Wait.

489
00:27:44.394 --> 00:27:47.264
I know what you're trying to do,

490
00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:49.067
and it won't work.

491
00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:50.201
They're gone.

492
00:28:04.248 --> 00:28:05.750
Get rid of the body.

493
00:28:05.782 --> 00:28:08.351
What was that?

494
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.323
Kill that guy.

495
00:28:47.023 --> 00:28:49.426
Stop sticking!

496
00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:10.981
<i>Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.</i>

497
00:29:36.073 --> 00:29:37.876
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

498
00:29:47.183 --> 00:29:49.119
Police! Put your hands up!

499
00:29:49.153 --> 00:29:50.889
Miles? Miles?

500
00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:53.590
Why aren't you at school?

501
00:29:53.624 --> 00:29:56.928
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.

502
00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.197
<i>Miles?
�Qu� te pasa?</i>

503
00:30:01.932 --> 00:30:03.300
Is it the earthquake?

504
00:30:05.035 --> 00:30:06.571
Can I sleep here tonight?

505
00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:08.239
Miles.
It's a weeknight.

506
00:30:08.271 --> 00:30:10.173
You made a commitment
to that school.

507
00:30:10.207 --> 00:30:11.810
He's upset.

508
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:16.213
Of course you can stay.

509
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.281
Dad?

510
00:30:18.282 --> 00:30:18.982
Yeah.

511
00:30:20.284 --> 00:30:23.153
Do you really hate
Spider-Man?

512
00:30:25.189 --> 00:30:27.959
Yeah. I mean, with
a vigilante, there is...

513
00:30:27.991 --> 00:30:29.259
<i>Jeff, mi amor.</i>

514
00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:31.228
What? He asked me.

515
00:30:31.261 --> 00:30:33.897
Baby, you know how I feel
about Spider-Man. Come on.

516
00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:38.001
<i>T� sabes que �l te quiere mucho.</i>

517
00:30:38.035 --> 00:30:40.938
That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?

518
00:30:40.971 --> 00:30:45.308
Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?

519
00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:49.013
Our family doesn't run
from things, Miles.

520
00:30:49.046 --> 00:30:51.182
Yeah, I know.

521
00:30:54.151 --> 00:30:55.486
What's that about?

522
00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:57.255
He's having a hard time, Jeff.

523
00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:58.588
When it gets hard,

524
00:30:58.622 --> 00:31:00.391
that's when
he's gotta stick it out.

525
00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:10.101
<i>We interrupt this broadcast
for a special report.</i>

526
00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:11.434
<i>Sad news tonight.</i>

527
00:31:11.468 --> 00:31:15.339
<i>The hero known as Spider-Man
has died</i>

528
00:31:15.372 --> 00:31:18.075
<i>after injuries related to
another powerful earthquake</i>

529
00:31:18.107 --> 00:31:20.912
<i>in Brooklyn.
Multiple sources are confirming</i>

530
00:31:20.944 --> 00:31:23.280
<i>that Peter Parker,
a 26-year-old grad student</i>

531
00:31:23.314 --> 00:31:25.016
<i>and part-time photographer</i>

532
00:31:25.048 --> 00:31:29.452
<i>operated as Spider-Man
for at least a decade.</i>

533
00:31:29.486 --> 00:31:32.456
<i>� I'm not runnin'
Runnin', runnin' �</i>

534
00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:34.625
<i>� No, I'm not afraid
Of the fall �</i>

535
00:31:34.657 --> 00:31:38.596
<i>� I'm not scared... �</i>

536
00:31:38.628 --> 00:31:41.432
<i>He is survived by
his wife, Mary Jane,</i>

537
00:31:41.464 --> 00:31:43.268
<i>and his aunt, May Parker.</i>

538
00:31:44.434 --> 00:31:47.203
<i>Our hero, Spider-Man, is gone.</i>

539
00:31:47.237 --> 00:31:48.639
<i>� I'm not scared... �</i>

540
00:31:48.672 --> 00:31:51.275
<i>My husband, Peter Parker,</i>

541
00:31:51.307 --> 00:31:54.077
<i>was an ordinary person.</i>

542
00:31:54.111 --> 00:31:57.480
<i>He always said it could've been
anyone behind the mask.</i>

543
00:31:57.513 --> 00:32:01.384
<i>He was just the kid
who happened to get bit.</i>

544
00:32:01.417 --> 00:32:03.721
I'm going to miss him.

545
00:32:03.753 --> 00:32:05.188
Yeah.

546
00:32:05.221 --> 00:32:07.258
We were friends, you know.

547
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.159
Can I return it
if it doesn't fit?

548
00:32:09.192 --> 00:32:11.494
It always fits

549
00:32:11.528 --> 00:32:13.431
eventually.

550
00:32:19.502 --> 00:32:21.505
<i>He didn't ask for his powers,</i>

551
00:32:24.607 --> 00:32:28.144
<i>but he chose to be Spider-Man.</i>

552
00:32:28.178 --> 00:32:30.748
<i>My favorite thing about Peter</i>

553
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.551
<i>is that he made us each
feel powerful.</i>

554
00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:38.556
<i>We all have powers
of one kind or another.</i>

555
00:32:38.588 --> 00:32:41.291
<i>� Of the dark... �</i>

556
00:32:41.325 --> 00:32:43.193
But in our own way.

557
00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:45.196
We are all Spider-Man.

558
00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:48.766
<i>And we're all counting on you.</i>

559
00:32:48.798 --> 00:32:50.634
They're counting on me.

560
00:32:50.666 --> 00:32:54.371
Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.

561
00:34:45.481 --> 00:34:48.152
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

562
00:34:48.184 --> 00:34:51.721
That thing you gave me, that key

563
00:34:51.755 --> 00:34:54.724
I think I really messed it up.

564
00:34:56.326 --> 00:34:58.528
I wanna do what you asked.

565
00:34:58.561 --> 00:35:00.330
I really do.

566
00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:03.400
But I'm sorry.

567
00:35:03.432 --> 00:35:06.670
I'm not sure I'm the guy.

568
00:35:06.702 --> 00:35:09.606
I can't do this without you.

569
00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:11.174
Hey, kid.

570
00:35:13.677 --> 00:35:14.778
Whoa!

571
00:35:17.648 --> 00:35:19.182
What did I do to him?!

572
00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:31.596
No.

573
00:35:36.233 --> 00:35:37.735
<i>Whoare you?</i>

574
00:35:39.835 --> 00:35:42.873
<i>All right, people,
let's do this one last time.</i>

575
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:47.378
<i>My name is Peter B. Parker.</i>

576
00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:50.581
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

577
00:35:50.614 --> 00:35:52.816
<i>And for the last 22 years,</i>

578
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:56.586
<i>I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

579
00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:59.389
What a day.

580
00:35:59.422 --> 00:36:01.724
<i>I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.</i>

581
00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:04.627
<i>You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married,</i>

582
00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:06.797
<i>saved the city some more,
maybe too much.</i>

583
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:09.699
<i>My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.</i>

584
00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:11.869
<i>Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.</i>

585
00:36:11.902 --> 00:36:14.804
<i>Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.</i>

586
00:36:14.838 --> 00:36:17.441
<i>I broke my back,
a drone flew into my face,</i>

587
00:36:17.474 --> 00:36:18.509
<i>I buried Aunt May.</i>

588
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:20.610
<i>My wife and I split up.</i>

589
00:36:20.643 --> 00:36:22.846
<i>But I handled it
like a champion.</i>

590
00:36:22.878 --> 00:36:24.714
<i>'Cause, you know what,</i>

591
00:36:24.748 --> 00:36:26.550
<i>no matter
how many times I get hit,</i>

592
00:36:26.583 --> 00:36:29.452
<i>I always get back up.</i>

593
00:36:33.023 --> 00:36:36.626
<i>And I got a lot of time
to reflect and work on myself.</i>

594
00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:39.762
<i>Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?</i>

595
00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:41.731
<i>Could you imagine?</i>

596
00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:44.902
<i>A seahorse seeing
another seahorse</i>

597
00:36:44.934 --> 00:36:46.804
<i>and then making it work?</i>

598
00:36:47.938 --> 00:36:50.740
<i>She wanted kids and...</i>

599
00:36:50.773 --> 00:36:52.609
<i>And it scared me.</i>

600
00:36:53.976 --> 00:36:56.547
<i>I'm pretty sure
I broke her heart.</i>

601
00:36:56.579 --> 00:36:58.915
<i>I'm in
my apartment doing push-ups,</i>

602
00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:00.951
<i>doing ab crunches,
getting strong,</i>

603
00:37:00.983 --> 00:37:03.319
<i>when this weird thing happened.</i>

604
00:37:03.353 --> 00:37:06.657
<i>And I gotta say, weird things
happen to me a lot.</i>

605
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.659
<i>But this was real weird.</i>

606
00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:52.836
Ow!

607
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:58.075
<i>You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.</i>

608
00:37:58.108 --> 00:38:00.778
<i>Also, I was dead.</i>

609
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:02.446
<i>And blond.</i>

610
00:38:02.478 --> 00:38:04.681
<i>I was kind of perfect.</i>

611
00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:08.485
<i>It was like looking in a mirror.</i>

612
00:38:08.518 --> 00:38:10.521
<i>I have a feeling that the thing</i>

613
00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.954
<i>that brought me here</i>

614
00:38:11.987 --> 00:38:14.857
<i>was the thing
that got him killed.</i>

615
00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:16.894
<i>You wanna know
what happened next?</i>

616
00:38:20.996 --> 00:38:22.432
<i>Me, too.</i>

617
00:38:22.465 --> 00:38:23.900
<i>Whoare you?</i>

618
00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.869
What are you doin' over there?

619
00:38:25.902 --> 00:38:28.338
Freeze! P.D.N.Y.

620
00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:29.440
Stop!

621
00:38:33.409 --> 00:38:35.445
Are you kidding me right now?

622
00:38:35.478 --> 00:38:36.913
Stop! Stop!

623
00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.615
I gotcha. I gotcha.

624
00:38:38.648 --> 00:38:40.451
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

625
00:38:42.786 --> 00:38:44.171
Hey, kid. Get over here!

626
00:38:44.172 --> 00:38:45.556
Come on, now!

627
00:38:45.588 --> 00:38:46.523
Whoa.

628
00:38:47.623 --> 00:38:50.660
See you, officers!

629
00:38:50.693 --> 00:38:51.961
Aw, come on.

630
00:38:57.634 --> 00:38:58.835
Hey, kid.

631
00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.036
Kid, come on, now!

632
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.772
Put 'em up, son!

633
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:07.143
<i>Uh... adi�s?</i>

634
00:39:11.114 --> 00:39:13.951
Help!
Somebody stop that train!

635
00:39:31.534 --> 00:39:33.136
Oh, hey. What the...?

636
00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:37.541
Sorry.

637
00:39:40.643 --> 00:39:44.481
I'm gonna die!

638
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:50.921
<i>Looks like a child

640
00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:56.559
Yes! I didn't kill you.

641
00:39:56.592 --> 00:39:57.577
Who are you?

642
00:39:57.578 --> 00:39:58.561
<i>Who areyou?</i>

643
00:39:58.594 --> 00:39:59.737
Why are you trying to kill me?

644
00:39:59.762 --> 00:40:01.531
I'm not. I'm trying to save you.

645
00:40:20.784 --> 00:40:23.052
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

646
00:40:23.085 --> 00:40:26.723
All right. Thanks, New York.

647
00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.568
<i>What was that?</i>

648
00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:41.103
<i>Kid electrocuted me</i>

649
00:40:41.137 --> 00:40:42.972
<i>with his hands.</i>

650
00:40:46.141 --> 00:40:47.460
You're like me.

651
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:48.778
I got some questions.

652
00:40:53.516 --> 00:40:55.117
Why do you look like
Peter Parker?

653
00:40:57.586 --> 00:40:59.121
Because I am Peter Parker.

654
00:40:59.155 --> 00:41:01.992
Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?

655
00:41:02.025 --> 00:41:04.528
Why are you older?
And why is your body

656
00:41:04.561 --> 00:41:05.996
a different shape?

657
00:41:06.028 --> 00:41:07.797
Pretty sure
you just called me fat.

658
00:41:07.831 --> 00:41:09.766
You don't look
so hot either, kid.

659
00:41:09.798 --> 00:41:11.902
Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.

660
00:41:11.934 --> 00:41:13.036
- Are you a ghost?
- No.

661
00:41:13.068 --> 00:41:13.787
Are you a zombie?

662
00:41:13.788 --> 00:41:14.505
Stop it.

663
00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.173
- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.

664
00:41:16.206 --> 00:41:18.909
Are you from another dimension?
Like a parallel universe

665
00:41:18.942 --> 00:41:20.252
where things are like
this universe but different?

666
00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:22.112
And you're Spider-Man
in that universe?

667
00:41:22.144 --> 00:41:24.014
But somehow traveled
to this universe,

668
00:41:24.047 --> 00:41:25.182
but you don't know how?

669
00:41:25.215 --> 00:41:26.817
Wow. That was really
just a guess?

670
00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:28.684
We learned about it in physics.

671
00:41:28.717 --> 00:41:29.719
Quantum theory.

672
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.721
This is amazing!

673
00:41:30.753 --> 00:41:32.788
You can teach me
like Peter said he would.

674
00:41:32.822 --> 00:41:33.891
Before he died.

675
00:41:33.923 --> 00:41:34.540
Yeah. Exactly.

676
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:35.157
Yeah, right.

677
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.926
Look, I made a promise to him.

678
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.628
Here's lesson number one, kid.

679
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:41.731
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

680
00:41:46.302 --> 00:41:48.239
Peter, seriously...

681
00:41:50.106 --> 00:41:52.242
Trust me, kid.

682
00:41:52.275 --> 00:41:54.577
This'll all make you
a better Spider-Man.

683
00:41:59.748 --> 00:42:01.284
Hey, are you okay?

684
00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.686
No, I'm not.

685
00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:04.086
What's going on with your body?

686
00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:05.989
I don't think my atoms
are real jazzed

687
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:07.757
about being
in the wrong dimension.

688
00:42:10.025 --> 00:42:11.928
Look, I'm not looking
for a side gig

689
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:13.329
as a Spider-Man coach.

690
00:42:13.362 --> 00:42:15.631
I got a lot going on
in my dimension.

691
00:42:15.664 --> 00:42:17.733
"With great power
comes great..."

692
00:42:17.766 --> 00:42:19.335
Don't you dare
finish that sentence.

693
00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:21.104
Don't do it!
I'm sick of it.

694
00:42:25.007 --> 00:42:27.877
Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.

695
00:42:27.911 --> 00:42:29.046
I don't have a choice!

696
00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.614
Kingpin's got a supercollider.

697
00:42:30.646 --> 00:42:32.048
He's tryin' to kill me.

698
00:42:32.081 --> 00:42:34.125
- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

699
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.219
Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?

700
00:42:36.251 --> 00:42:38.087
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

701
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:39.256
- Goodbye.
- Where you going?

702
00:42:39.289 --> 00:42:40.924
When it runs again, I'll jump in

703
00:42:40.956 --> 00:42:42.366
- and get back to my life.
- You can't let them run it.

704
00:42:42.391 --> 00:42:43.926
I'm supposed to destroy it

705
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.996
so it never runs again
or everyone's gonna die.

706
00:42:46.028 --> 00:42:49.666
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

707
00:42:49.699 --> 00:42:52.668
But there's always a little bit
of time before everybody dies

708
00:42:52.702 --> 00:42:54.037
and that's when I do
my best work.

709
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.739
Aren't you gonna need this?

710
00:42:55.771 --> 00:42:57.340
Aw, you have a goober.
Give it.

711
00:42:57.373 --> 00:43:00.810
Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.

712
00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:03.646
There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.

713
00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:04.880
I can never remember,

714
00:43:04.914 --> 00:43:06.123
so I always call it
a goober. Give it.

715
00:43:06.148 --> 00:43:07.851
I need it
to destroy the collider.

716
00:43:07.884 --> 00:43:09.251
I need it to go home.

717
00:43:09.284 --> 00:43:10.853
I'll swallow it.
Don't play with me.

718
00:43:10.887 --> 00:43:11.939
What?

719
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.990
I said...

720
00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:15.392
The collider created a portal
that brought me here.

721
00:43:15.425 --> 00:43:17.027
And I have to get...

722
00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:19.111
Did you break this?

723
00:43:19.112 --> 00:43:21.163
No, it broke.

724
00:43:21.197 --> 00:43:22.798
I don't remember what happened.

725
00:43:22.831 --> 00:43:24.333
See, this is why
I never had kids.

726
00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:25.902
Can't we make another one?

727
00:43:25.934 --> 00:43:27.938
<i>We can't do anything.
Thanks to you,</i>

728
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:30.907
I have to re-steal what
your guy stole from Alchemax

729
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.777
and make another one of these.

730
00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:35.811
If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave,

731
00:43:35.844 --> 00:43:37.313
everyone in this city,

732
00:43:37.347 --> 00:43:40.182
my parents, my uncle and
millions of others, will die.

733
00:43:40.215 --> 00:43:41.851
And you're just gonna go home

734
00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:44.153
and leave me here
to figure this out for myself?

735
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:45.671
You good with that, Spider-Man?

736
00:43:45.672 --> 00:43:47.156
Yeah.

737
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.367
What are you doing?

738
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.739
Making you feel guilty.
Is it working?

739
00:44:02.771 --> 00:44:05.007
How could it...? No.
Look at me.

740
00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:06.777
Does it look like it's working?

741
00:44:06.809 --> 00:44:10.346
No. No, it's not...

742
00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:16.987
No! No! No!
Do not let him win!

743
00:44:18.054 --> 00:44:19.389
All right, kid. You win.

744
00:44:19.422 --> 00:44:21.891
Come on, we don't have
a second to lose.

745
00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:24.728
Mmm. I love this burger.
So delicious.

746
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.697
One of the best burgers
I've ever had.

747
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.365
In my universe, this place
closed six years ago.

748
00:44:29.398 --> 00:44:31.233
I don't know why.
I really don't.

749
00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:32.268
Mmm.

750
00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:36.972
You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.

751
00:44:37.005 --> 00:44:37.890
Can we focus?

752
00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:38.774
Mm-hm. Sure.

753
00:44:38.807 --> 00:44:40.076
The other Peter...

754
00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:41.344
You gonna eat that?

755
00:44:42.378 --> 00:44:43.747
I'm listening.

756
00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.348
The other Peter said
he was gonna be

757
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.315
showing me the ropes.

758
00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.250
Wow.

759
00:44:47.282 --> 00:44:49.985
You got any Spider-Man tips
you can tell me now?

760
00:44:50.018 --> 00:44:50.986
Yeah, I got plenty.

761
00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:52.422
Disinfect the mask.

762
00:44:52.454 --> 00:44:54.891
You're gonna wanna use
baby powder in the suit,

763
00:44:54.923 --> 00:44:56.092
heavy on the joints.

764
00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.261
You don't want
any chafing, right?

765
00:44:58.293 --> 00:44:59.528
Anything else?

766
00:44:59.529 --> 00:45:00.763
Nope, that was everything.

767
00:45:00.797 --> 00:45:02.465
I think you're gonna be
a bad teacher.

768
00:45:02.498 --> 00:45:05.033
Uh-uh-uh?
Look up where Alchemax is.

769
00:45:05.034 --> 00:45:08.371
"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."

770
00:45:08.403 --> 00:45:09.873
You can teach me

771
00:45:09.905 --> 00:45:11.141
to swing on the way there.

772
00:45:14.476 --> 00:45:16.812
I'm not swinging to
the Hudson Valley, Miles.

773
00:45:16.846 --> 00:45:18.748
Not after a hearty
burger breakfast.

774
00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:21.085
Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.

775
00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:25.221
<i>� I can see a new horizon �</i>

776
00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:27.057
<i>� Underneath the blazing sky �</i>

777
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.227
<i>� I'll be where the eagle's
Flying higher... �</i>

778
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.328
And it's a no on the cape.

779
00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:32.395
I think it's cool.

780
00:45:32.427 --> 00:45:34.130
Take that off.
It's disrespectful.

781
00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:36.099
Spider-Man doesn't
wear a cape.

782
00:45:36.132 --> 00:45:39.202
So how do we retrace
Peter's steps?

783
00:45:39.235 --> 00:45:41.171
That's a good question.

784
00:45:41.204 --> 00:45:44.041
What would I do if I were me?

785
00:45:44.873 --> 00:45:46.175
Got it.

786
00:45:46.208 --> 00:45:48.177
<i>I infiltrate the lab.</i>

787
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.146
<i>Find the head scientist's
computer.</i>

788
00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:52.348
<i>That lady with the bike
is the head scientist.</i>

789
00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.416
<i>I saw her in this documentary.</i>

790
00:45:54.449 --> 00:45:56.852
<i>Cool! Step Three: I reexamine
my personal biases.</i>

791
00:45:56.885 --> 00:45:58.088
<i>I hack the computer.</i>

792
00:45:58.121 --> 00:45:59.422
It's not technically hacking.

793
00:45:59.454 --> 00:46:01.458
Not now. I just lost
my train of thought.

794
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.393
<i>Download the important stuff.</i>

795
00:46:03.425 --> 00:46:05.194
<i>I'll know it when I see it.</i>

796
00:46:05.228 --> 00:46:08.063
<i>I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.</i>

797
00:46:08.097 --> 00:46:09.833
So, what am I doing?

798
00:46:09.865 --> 00:46:12.969
You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.

799
00:46:13.001 --> 00:46:15.572
Look, man. You gotta teach me
how to do Spider-Man stuff

800
00:46:15.605 --> 00:46:17.173
or I won't be able to help.

801
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:21.278
Watch and learn, kid!
I'll quiz ya later!

802
00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:25.315
Why did I get stuck with

803
00:46:25.347 --> 00:46:27.550
the janky, old, broke
hobo Spider-Man?!

804
00:46:29.117 --> 00:46:30.953
That's new.

805
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.298
Kingpin.

806
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.969
<i>What am I doing?
What am I doing?</i>

807
00:46:47.003 --> 00:46:48.438
<i>What am I doing?
What am I doing?</i>

808
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.981
Whoa!

809
00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:07.023
Peter!

810
00:47:07.056 --> 00:47:08.858
Peter!

811
00:47:08.891 --> 00:47:10.226
Peter!

812
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.295
What are you doing here?

813
00:47:11.296 --> 00:47:12.329
Kingpin's here.

814
00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.864
Just move over.

815
00:47:13.896 --> 00:47:16.565
You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.

816
00:47:16.599 --> 00:47:19.068
No! I can't sit there
and let Spider-Man die

817
00:47:19.101 --> 00:47:20.536
without doing anything about it.

818
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.039
I'm not doing that again.

819
00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:24.641
What?

820
00:47:24.673 --> 00:47:28.612
Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me,

821
00:47:28.644 --> 00:47:30.313
so you're a nice change of pace.

822
00:47:31.581 --> 00:47:33.583
Mr. Fisk!
Look at this data.

823
00:47:33.615 --> 00:47:35.485
I know you can't
really understand it,

824
00:47:35.518 --> 00:47:37.186
but these are
really good numbers.

825
00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:39.990
And I got the password.

826
00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:42.425
Mr. Fisk.
If we fire again this week

827
00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:45.061
there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.

828
00:47:45.094 --> 00:47:46.596
You see this? And this?

829
00:47:46.628 --> 00:47:48.230
This is multiple dimensions

830
00:47:48.264 --> 00:47:50.467
beginning to crash
into each other.

831
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.635
This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes.

832
00:47:52.668 --> 00:47:54.403
You get used to it.
Watch this.

833
00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:57.239
He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."

834
00:47:57.273 --> 00:47:58.541
You've got 24 hours.

835
00:47:58.574 --> 00:48:00.644
What this means is there
could be a rupture

836
00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:02.144
in the space-time
continuum.

837
00:48:02.177 --> 00:48:03.380
Ooh. That's bad.

838
00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.981
Actually, everything
she said was bad.

839
00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:05.981
I was lying before.

840
00:48:14.556 --> 00:48:17.360
Hold on. Let me get you
some more data.

841
00:48:19.228 --> 00:48:20.613
What are you doing, bud?

842
00:48:20.614 --> 00:48:21.998
I can't move.

843
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.500
Okay, relax your fingers.

844
00:48:23.532 --> 00:48:26.536
We don't have time.
Just let go. Be in the moment.

845
00:48:26.568 --> 00:48:28.637
I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.

846
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:29.989
I'm not refusing.

847
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.307
No more excuses.

848
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.976
I just need more time.

849
00:48:33.009 --> 00:48:35.077
They're right there.
They're gonna see you.

850
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.012
Miles, you gotta unstick.

851
00:48:37.045 --> 00:48:38.948
What do you do to relax?

852
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:42.052
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

853
00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:45.188
� Needless to say, I... �

854
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:47.222
Oh, for crying out loud.

855
00:48:47.255 --> 00:48:49.992
� Callin' it quits
Now, baby, I'm a wreck �

856
00:48:51.527 --> 00:48:54.364
� You're a wreck, ooh... �

857
00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:59.102
just the worst.

858
00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:02.589
Miles, where did you go?

859
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:03.706
I'm right here.

860
00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:05.441
Where? I can't see ya.

861
00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:07.142
I'm right in front of you.

862
00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:08.427
Can Spider-Man turn invisible?

863
00:49:08.428 --> 00:49:09.679
Not in my universe.

864
00:49:09.711 --> 00:49:11.581
Aah! You just poked me
in my eye!

865
00:49:11.614 --> 00:49:14.351
This is incredible. Some kind
of fight or flight thing.

866
00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:15.318
What's that?

867
00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:20.623
Remember this password.
D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D...

868
00:49:20.655 --> 00:49:21.623
Slow down!

869
00:49:21.657 --> 00:49:25.061
-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

870
00:49:25.094 --> 00:49:26.229
I need to write it down!

871
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.364
Download the schematic.

872
00:49:27.396 --> 00:49:28.682
How do I do that?

873
00:49:28.683 --> 00:49:29.967
While I turn on the charm.

874
00:49:32.034 --> 00:49:33.168
Spider-Man?

875
00:49:33.202 --> 00:49:35.772
Oh, hey.
Didn't see you there.

876
00:49:35.804 --> 00:49:37.172
Wow.

877
00:49:37.206 --> 00:49:39.342
Okay, I'm kinda
freaking out right now.

878
00:49:39.375 --> 00:49:41.177
You're supposed to be dead.

879
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:44.481
Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no.
We don't like that.

880
00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.249
This is fascinating.

881
00:49:46.282 --> 00:49:48.018
Okay, that's my face.

882
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.253
An entirely different
Peter Parker.

883
00:49:50.286 --> 00:49:53.088
Little bit of a gut, perhaps
from dimensional warping.

884
00:49:53.121 --> 00:49:55.625
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. I was way
flatter before I warped.

885
00:49:55.657 --> 00:49:57.493
Travel through the multiverse

886
00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.496
appears to have
deteriorated the...

887
00:49:59.528 --> 00:50:01.597
What was the rest?!

888
00:50:03.132 --> 00:50:04.567
Hey, how old are you?

889
00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:07.202
'Cause you don't look
a day over 35.

890
00:50:07.235 --> 00:50:09.772
- They said I was crazy!
- They said I was crazy!

891
00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.673
You showed 'em you're not crazy.

892
00:50:11.706 --> 00:50:13.442
This might pinch a little.

893
00:50:16.411 --> 00:50:18.380
I know. I just need
to get these samples.

894
00:50:18.414 --> 00:50:19.616
Okay.

895
00:50:19.648 --> 00:50:21.417
Organize your desktop, lady.

896
00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:24.420
Wow. Just complete
cellular decay.

897
00:50:25.621 --> 00:50:27.356
I've never seen
anything like this.

898
00:50:27.389 --> 00:50:28.590
What are you doing?

899
00:50:28.623 --> 00:50:30.526
I'm just taking the whole thing.

900
00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:32.327
And obviously
you've been glitching.

901
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.464
"Glitchin'"? No.
Why would you even say that?

902
00:50:35.498 --> 00:50:37.400
If you stay in this dimension
too long,

903
00:50:37.432 --> 00:50:39.068
your body's gonna disintegrate.

904
00:50:39.101 --> 00:50:41.078
Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?

905
00:50:41.103 --> 00:50:42.071
I don't know.

906
00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:44.173
You can't imagine.

907
00:50:44.206 --> 00:50:46.208
And I, for one,

908
00:50:46.242 --> 00:50:48.045
can't wait to watch.

909
00:50:50.146 --> 00:50:51.514
What did you say your name was?

910
00:50:51.547 --> 00:50:53.416
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

911
00:51:01.724 --> 00:51:03.860
Can I assume that your friends
call you Doc Ock?

912
00:51:03.893 --> 00:51:06.295
My friends actually call me Liv.

913
00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.731
My enemies call me Doc Ock.

914
00:51:08.764 --> 00:51:10.300
I got this! Run!

915
00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.367
Who are you talking to?

916
00:51:14.269 --> 00:51:15.754
I got it!

917
00:51:15.755 --> 00:51:17.239
Oh, you "got it," Peter?

918
00:51:19.275 --> 00:51:20.710
I got it handled, buddy!

919
00:51:22.577 --> 00:51:24.213
Everything is fine!

920
00:51:26.815 --> 00:51:28.317
Okay, this is

921
00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:29.336
a little bit bad.

922
00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:30.320
You're chatty.

923
00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.221
Gotta go.

924
00:51:33.922 --> 00:51:36.525
This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.

925
00:51:38.693 --> 00:51:41.697
Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.

926
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:44.200
Peter!

927
00:51:44.233 --> 00:51:47.871
You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!

928
00:51:47.903 --> 00:51:49.806
Could you give me that back,
young man?

929
00:51:49.838 --> 00:51:51.807
Peter!

930
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.277
It's proprietary.

931
00:51:58.847 --> 00:52:00.616
Oh.

932
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.718
This'd be a good time

933
00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:02.569
to turn invisible.

934
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.386
Yep.

935
00:52:03.418 --> 00:52:06.588
Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.

936
00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:08.290
Act super normal.

937
00:52:08.324 --> 00:52:09.425
Spider-Man?

938
00:52:09.458 --> 00:52:10.626
You know, that's funny,

939
00:52:10.659 --> 00:52:11.493
I get that a lot.

940
00:52:11.494 --> 00:52:12.327
Hey.

941
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.462
Spider-Man?

942
00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.563
Hey! Hands up!

943
00:52:14.597 --> 00:52:15.865
Now we do
a switchy-switchy.

944
00:52:15.898 --> 00:52:17.267
Get back here!

945
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.476
Where do you think you're going?

946
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:19.502
He took a bagel!

947
00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:20.503
Time to swing,

948
00:52:20.536 --> 00:52:21.704
just like I taught ya.

949
00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:22.871
When did you teach me that?

950
00:52:22.905 --> 00:52:25.475
I didn't. It's a little joke
for team-building.

951
00:52:25.507 --> 00:52:27.242
Hey!

952
00:52:27.275 --> 00:52:28.360
All right, you ready?

953
00:52:28.361 --> 00:52:29.444
Of course I'm not ready!

954
00:52:31.347 --> 00:52:32.682
I can't do this yet!

955
00:52:32.715 --> 00:52:34.751
Everybody knows
that the best way to learn

956
00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.820
is under intense
life-threatening pressure.

957
00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:41.791
Come on, come on, come on.

958
00:52:45.728 --> 00:52:47.297
Uh-oh.

959
00:52:52.668 --> 00:52:54.637
What are you doing down there?

960
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.539
I run better than I swing.

961
00:52:56.572 --> 00:52:59.642
You gotta swing
or they'll catch you.

962
00:52:59.675 --> 00:53:01.911
This is what you wanted.

963
00:53:07.516 --> 00:53:08.918
Uh-oh.

964
00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:16.492
Come back, little boy.

965
00:53:16.525 --> 00:53:18.860
Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.

966
00:53:18.893 --> 00:53:21.330
Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!

967
00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.798
Don't shoot off your back foot.

968
00:53:22.831 --> 00:53:24.166
That's too many things!

969
00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:25.500
Then stop listening to me!

970
00:53:25.534 --> 00:53:28.605
That's the best idea
you've had all day!

971
00:53:35.677 --> 00:53:38.214
Nice, Miles!

972
00:53:41.416 --> 00:53:43.318
Good. You're doin' it.

973
00:53:43.351 --> 00:53:45.922
Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.

974
00:53:45.954 --> 00:53:47.789
Thwip and release.

975
00:53:47.822 --> 00:53:49.425
And thwip. Release. Thwip.

976
00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:51.027
And release.

977
00:53:51.059 --> 00:53:52.795
You're a natural.
Thwip. Release.

978
00:53:52.827 --> 00:53:54.179
Feel the rhythm?

979
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.530
Thwip. And release!

980
00:53:55.563 --> 00:53:56.732
Good, Miles.

981
00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:58.835
I gotta say,
you're amazing, man.

982
00:53:58.867 --> 00:54:00.369
We're a little team!

983
00:54:00.402 --> 00:54:02.337
Me as the teacher
who could still do it.

984
00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:05.375
You as the student who can
do it, just not as good.

985
00:54:05.407 --> 00:54:08.244
I'm proud of us. Is there
something you want to say to me?

986
00:54:10.378 --> 00:54:11.347
Peter!

987
00:54:23.826 --> 00:54:24.677
What the...?

988
00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:25.528
Who did that?

989
00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:53.423
Hey, guys.

990
00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:54.557
Gwanda?

991
00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:56.358
It's Gwen, actually.

992
00:54:56.391 --> 00:54:59.328
Oh, you know her.
Very cool.

993
00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:01.097
I'm from another dimension.

994
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.334
I mean,
another-another dimension.

995
00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:07.003
<i>All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.</i>

996
00:55:07.036 --> 00:55:08.738
<i>My name is Gwen Stacy.</i>

997
00:55:08.771 --> 00:55:11.574
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

998
00:55:11.606 --> 00:55:13.375
<i>And for the last two years,</i>

999
00:55:13.409 --> 00:55:16.646
<i>I've been the one
and only Spider-Woman.</i>

1000
00:55:16.679 --> 00:55:18.581
<i>You guys know the rest.</i>

1001
00:55:18.614 --> 00:55:20.083
<i>I joined a band.</i>

1002
00:55:21.884 --> 00:55:23.586
<i>Saved my dad.</i>

1003
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.358
<i>I couldn't save my best friend,</i>

1004
00:55:29.391 --> 00:55:30.859
<i>Peter Parker,</i>

1005
00:55:32.561 --> 00:55:34.731
<i>so now I save everyone else.</i>

1006
00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:37.666
<i>And I don't do friends anymore,</i>

1007
00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:39.335
<i>just to avoid any distractions.</i>

1008
00:55:40.835 --> 00:55:45.006
<i>And one day
this weird thing happened.</i>

1009
00:55:45.039 --> 00:55:48.110
<i>And I mean, like, really weird.</i>

1010
00:55:53.715 --> 00:55:56.385
<i>I was blown into last week.</i>

1011
00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.891
<i>Literally.</i>

1012
00:56:01.923 --> 00:56:05.527
<i>I landed in New York,
but not my New York.</i>

1013
00:56:06.862 --> 00:56:08.498
<i>Lucky for these folks,</i>

1014
00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.766
<i>Spider-Man was there
to save the day.</i>

1015
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.936
<i>My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.</i>

1016
00:56:13.969 --> 00:56:15.938
...you guys are early.

1017
00:56:15.971 --> 00:56:18.974
<i>Wasn't sure why until I met you.</i>

1018
00:56:19.007 --> 00:56:19.942
Oh!

1019
00:56:20.909 --> 00:56:22.144
I like your haircut.

1020
00:56:22.177 --> 00:56:24.045
You don't get to like
my haircut.

1021
00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:25.548
Let's go.

1022
00:56:25.581 --> 00:56:26.891
How many more Spider-People
are there?

1023
00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.050
Save it
for Comic-Con.

1024
00:56:28.083 --> 00:56:30.153
What's Comic-Con?
Whoa!

1025
00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:48.704
You're dead, Spider-Man.

1026
00:56:48.737 --> 00:56:50.907
Wilson!
What are you doing?

1027
00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.074
Vanessa.

1028
00:56:52.106 --> 00:56:53.476
Richard, come on.

1029
00:56:57.045 --> 00:56:58.880
Vanessa! Richard!

1030
00:56:58.914 --> 00:57:00.516
<i>No!</i>

1031
00:57:00.548 --> 00:57:03.085
Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

1032
00:57:21.936 --> 00:57:23.873
I killed Spider-Man.

1033
00:57:23.905 --> 00:57:25.942
Why did I just see two more?

1034
00:57:25.974 --> 00:57:28.210
There's three, actually.

1035
00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:31.247
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.

1036
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.949
This means
you get what you want.

1037
00:57:32.981 --> 00:57:36.117
It means my collider works.

1038
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:39.588
All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.

1039
00:57:39.621 --> 00:57:42.257
And the collider will bring
your family back.

1040
00:57:42.291 --> 00:57:44.894
As many families as you want.

1041
00:57:53.869 --> 00:57:56.806
Tomorrow, at my collider.

1042
00:57:56.838 --> 00:57:58.907
Our collider.

1043
00:58:02.143 --> 00:58:03.645
He broke this?

1044
00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:06.182
Yeah. He's actually
really embarrassed about it,

1045
00:58:06.215 --> 00:58:08.284
so just keep it
between us, okay?

1046
00:58:09.717 --> 00:58:11.520
I know where we
can make a new one.

1047
00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:13.722
And we won't let him
break it this time.

1048
00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:17.961
I'm sorry about your friend.

1049
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:20.829
Thanks, Miles.

1050
00:58:23.097 --> 00:58:24.866
I know how hard this is.

1051
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.570
To have to figure
this stuff out on your own.

1052
00:58:27.603 --> 00:58:30.740
It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.

1053
00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.141
Yeah.

1054
00:58:33.608 --> 00:58:35.978
If you ever decide
to do friends again,

1055
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:37.746
I could always open up a slot.

1056
00:58:39.114 --> 00:58:41.884
I'll keep you posted.

1057
00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:43.952
Cool.

1058
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.559
We should probably go.

1059
00:58:50.592 --> 00:58:52.894
Peter, we're literally
on the doorstep.

1060
00:58:52.927 --> 00:58:54.797
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

1061
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:56.331
Just relax.

1062
00:58:56.364 --> 00:58:58.133
You guys are all very sweet,

1063
00:58:58.166 --> 00:59:00.603
but no more fans today, please.

1064
00:59:03.972 --> 00:59:05.608
I'm not ready for this.

1065
00:59:10.311 --> 00:59:11.880
Peter?

1066
00:59:13.748 --> 00:59:15.717
Hey, Aunt May.

1067
00:59:15.751 --> 00:59:17.753
So this is gonna sound crazy,

1068
00:59:17.786 --> 00:59:20.222
but I'm pretty sure
that I'm from an...

1069
00:59:20.255 --> 00:59:22.224
An alternate dimension.

1070
00:59:22.257 --> 00:59:23.559
Yeah.

1071
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.896
You look tired, Peter.

1072
00:59:26.929 --> 00:59:29.097
Well, I am tired.

1073
00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:30.699
And older. And thicker.

1074
00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.268
Yeah. I've heard that already.

1075
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.804
Oh, jeez.
Are those sweatpants?

1076
00:59:34.836 --> 00:59:37.039
Yup, that's what they are.

1077
00:59:37.072 --> 00:59:38.941
I was there,

1078
00:59:38.974 --> 00:59:41.309
when it all happened.

1079
00:59:41.342 --> 00:59:43.378
I am so sorry.

1080
00:59:43.411 --> 00:59:45.647
And what dimension are you from?

1081
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:47.717
Brooklyn.

1082
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.987
Did Peter have a place where we
could make another one of these?

1083
00:59:51.019 --> 00:59:52.822
A goober.

1084
00:59:54.088 --> 00:59:55.257
Follow me.

1085
00:59:58.427 --> 01:00:00.663
Oh, yeah,
I got one of these, too.

1086
01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:02.931
A little, old shed
where I keep my Spider-gear.

1087
01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:17.346
I mean,
this place is pretentious.

1088
01:00:24.452 --> 01:00:26.221
Whoa.

1089
01:00:30.858 --> 01:00:32.728
Dude. Was yours
anything like this?

1090
01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.029
Mine was like this,

1091
01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:36.097
but take away the jeep,
the plane.

1092
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:39.902
Imagine it way smaller.
Imagine a futon.

1093
01:00:39.934 --> 01:00:42.304
I feel sad for this guy.

1094
01:00:56.284 --> 01:00:57.386
Hey, Peter.

1095
01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.856
I think this is a cape.

1096
01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:20.409
Peter knew
how dangerous the job was.

1097
01:01:20.442 --> 01:01:23.179
But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy

1098
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:24.947
was Spider-Man.

1099
01:01:26.414 --> 01:01:28.349
Kingpin knows we're coming.

1100
01:01:28.382 --> 01:01:30.318
We're going to be outnumbered.

1101
01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:32.721
Don't be so sure.

1102
01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.791
You might need these.

1103
01:01:39.393 --> 01:01:42.297
You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?

1104
01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:46.268
Hey, fellas.

1105
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.969
Is he in black and white?

1106
01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:50.372
Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.

1107
01:01:50.405 --> 01:01:52.173
Wherever I go, the wind follows.

1108
01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:55.077
And the wind,
it smells like rain.

1109
01:01:56.177 --> 01:01:57.145
Hi, guys!

1110
01:02:02.317 --> 01:02:04.753
This could literally not
get any weirder.

1111
01:02:04.786 --> 01:02:07.522
<i>Itcan get weirder.</i>

1112
01:02:07.556 --> 01:02:10.860
I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.

1113
01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.929
No other reason.

1114
01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:22.270
You're like me.

1115
01:02:25.239 --> 01:02:26.442
<i>My name is Peter Parker.</i>

1116
01:02:26.474 --> 01:02:28.110
<i>My name is Peni Parker.</i>

1117
01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:30.112
<i>My name is Peter Porker.</i>

1118
01:02:30.144 --> 01:02:31.880
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

1119
01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:33.282
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive pig.</i>

1120
01:02:33.315 --> 01:02:35.451
<i>In my universe, it's 1933,</i>

1121
01:02:35.483 --> 01:02:37.052
<i>and I'm a private eye.</i>

1122
01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.387
<i>I like to drink egg creams,</i>

1123
01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.822
<i>and I like to fight Nazis.
A lot.</i>

1124
01:02:40.856 --> 01:02:42.958
<i>I'm from New York
in the year 3145.</i>

1125
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:44.559
<i>I have a psychic link
with a spider</i>

1126
01:02:44.592 --> 01:02:46.361
<i>who lives inside
my father's robot.</i>

1127
01:02:46.394 --> 01:02:48.998
<i>And we're best friends.
Forever.</i>

1128
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:51.065
<i>Sometimes I let matches
burn down to my fingertips</i>

1129
01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:52.434
<i>just to feel something,
anything.</i>

1130
01:02:53.835 --> 01:02:54.836
<i>I'm a photographer</i>

1131
01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:55.938
<i>for the Daily Beagle.</i>

1132
01:02:55.971 --> 01:02:57.047
<i>When I'm not pooching around,</i>

1133
01:02:57.072 --> 01:02:58.474
<i>I'm working like a dog,</i>

1134
01:02:58.507 --> 01:02:59.817
<i>trying to sniff out
the latest story.</i>

1135
01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:00.943
� I frolic and I dance �

1136
01:03:00.976 --> 01:03:01.985
� And I do this With my pants �

1137
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.579
Okay! Enough!

1138
01:03:03.612 --> 01:03:06.849
So how did you get here?

1139
01:03:06.882 --> 01:03:09.050
Well, it's kind of a long story.

1140
01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:15.324
Maybe not that long.

1141
01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:18.427
And now we're just trying
to find a way home.

1142
01:03:20.295 --> 01:03:22.998
The only way home is back
through that collider gizmo.

1143
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.333
The only trouble is...

1144
01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:27.570
One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.

1145
01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:28.303
I'll do it.

1146
01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.003
I'll do it.

1147
01:03:29.036 --> 01:03:31.406
No, no, no.
You guys don't get it.

1148
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.242
Don't get what?

1149
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.250
None of you can stay here.
If you stay here, you'll die.

1150
01:03:41.282 --> 01:03:43.485
I'm the guy
who's gonna turn it off.

1151
01:03:43.518 --> 01:03:47.322
And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.

1152
01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:51.394
Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.

1153
01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:57.465
Who are you again?

1154
01:03:57.498 --> 01:03:58.867
This is Miles.

1155
01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.435
And he's gonna save
the multiverse.

1156
01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.903
Yeah, man.

1157
01:04:01.936 --> 01:04:03.505
This kid can turn himself
invisible.

1158
01:04:03.538 --> 01:04:05.039
Watch this.
He can do it now.

1159
01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:09.077
I can't do it on command.

1160
01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:10.612
He can't do it on command.

1161
01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:13.382
But it is cool. Show 'em
the zappy thing, Miles.

1162
01:04:15.217 --> 01:04:16.852
Can't do it on command.

1163
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.487
He can't do it on command.

1164
01:04:18.519 --> 01:04:21.023
But he can do so much more.
What else do you do?

1165
01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.491
Just those two things.

1166
01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:23.925
Just those two things.

1167
01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:25.426
Aw, man.

1168
01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:30.066
Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.

1169
01:04:31.233 --> 01:04:33.436
I think he's gonna get us home.

1170
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:36.605
Okay, little fella,

1171
01:04:36.637 --> 01:04:38.940
Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.

1172
01:04:38.974 --> 01:04:41.043
I'm talkin' hard boys,
real biscuit boxers.

1173
01:04:41.076 --> 01:04:42.945
Can you fight them
all off at once?

1174
01:04:42.978 --> 01:04:45.213
I haven't actually
fought anyone.

1175
01:04:45.246 --> 01:04:46.382
Surprise attack!

1176
01:04:48.115 --> 01:04:50.351
Can you rewire a mainframe
while being shot at?

1177
01:04:50.385 --> 01:04:50.903
Can I what?

1178
01:04:50.904 --> 01:04:51.420
Show me!

1179
01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:53.255
Surprise attack!

1180
01:04:53.288 --> 01:04:55.098
Can you swing and flip with
the grace of a trained dancer?

1181
01:04:55.123 --> 01:04:57.067
Can you close off your feelings
so you don't get crippled

1182
01:04:57.092 --> 01:04:58.961
by the moral ambiguity
of your violent actions?

1183
01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:01.103
Can you help your aunt create
an online dating profile

1184
01:05:01.128 --> 01:05:03.105
so she can get out of
the dang house once in a while?

1185
01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:06.367
Can you float through the air
when you smell a delicious pie?

1186
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.702
- Can you be strong?
- Ruthless?

1187
01:05:07.735 --> 01:05:08.603
Disciplined?

1188
01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:09.471
I don't know. Maybe.

1189
01:05:09.503 --> 01:05:11.339
- Psychic?
- Show me some moxie, soldier!

1190
01:05:11.373 --> 01:05:14.242
Above all, no matter
how many times you get hit,

1191
01:05:14.275 --> 01:05:15.677
can you get back up?

1192
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:17.645
'Cause when a Spider-Man
is on the floor...

1193
01:05:17.679 --> 01:05:19.548
When you think
you can't keep goin'...

1194
01:05:19.581 --> 01:05:20.582
Come on, Miles.

1195
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.583
Come on. You can do it.

1196
01:05:21.615 --> 01:05:22.634
You can do this.

1197
01:05:22.635 --> 01:05:23.652
Guys, cool it.

1198
01:05:23.684 --> 01:05:25.136
Come on. You can do it!

1199
01:05:25.137 --> 01:05:26.587
Get up, Miles.

1200
01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:28.657
Come on, Miles. Get up.

1201
01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.432
You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.

1202
01:05:37.465 --> 01:05:38.666
He's not ready.
It's obvious.

1203
01:05:38.699 --> 01:05:40.335
There's no way.
He's just a kid.

1204
01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:41.537
If he can't do this,

1205
01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.272
we have to stay
and do it for him.

1206
01:05:43.304 --> 01:05:46.107
He's looking right at us
while we talk about him.

1207
01:05:46.141 --> 01:05:47.543
Miles?

1208
01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:48.577
Miles?

1209
01:05:51.545 --> 01:05:54.750
You see that? He can, um...

1210
01:05:54.782 --> 01:05:57.085
He can turn invisible.

1211
01:05:59.454 --> 01:06:03.158

with you?</i>

1215
01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.070
<i>Nobody's heard from you.
We don't know what's going on.</i>

1216
01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:18.007
<i>If you're hidin' something from
us, you need to come clean.</i>

1217

<i>You call me back. Now.</i>

1218
01:06:21.409 --> 01:06:23.578
He's not answering me either.

1219
01:06:26.213 --> 01:06:29.150
<i>It's Aaron. I'm outta town
for a few days.</i>

1220
01:06:29.184 --> 01:06:30.686
<i>I'll hit you when I'm back.
Peace.</i>

1221
01:06:30.719 --> 01:06:33.188
Aaron, it's Jeff.

1222
01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:36.257
Look, I need you to call me
if you've heard from Miles.

1223

<i>He has a...</i>

1224

<i>He has a soft spot for you,</i>

1225
01:06:42.197 --> 01:06:44.099
and we haven't heard from him.

1226
01:06:44.132 --> 01:06:47.635
And you know I wouldn't reach
out if this wasn't important.

1227
01:06:47.668 --> 01:06:49.471
Hope you're good.

1228
01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:53.041

I don't know if I can do it.</i>

1230
01:06:58.246 --> 01:07:00.715

1231

<i>I'm just tired of
lettin' everybody down.</i>

1233
01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:14.429
<i>I just wish you were here.</i>

1234
01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.286
Hello, Mr. Fisk.

1235
01:08:11.318 --> 01:08:14.456
I've got the security tapes
from the tunnel right here.

1236
01:08:14.489 --> 01:08:17.592
If the kid's out there,
I'll find him.

1237
01:08:19.493 --> 01:08:22.163
You know me, sir.
I don't ever quit.

1238

1244
01:10:10.337 --> 01:10:12.373
This is...

1245
01:10:12.407 --> 01:10:13.358
Purple.

1246
01:10:13.359 --> 01:10:14.309
No.

1247
01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:14.925
Blue?

1248
01:10:14.926 --> 01:10:15.509
No.

1249
01:10:15.542 --> 01:10:17.246
Has anyone heard from Miles?

1250
01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:19.615
Look, he's just clearing
his head. I know the kid.

1251
01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.483
He's got what it takes.

1252
01:10:21.515 --> 01:10:24.252
I bet you he's gonna come back
through that door,

1253
01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:26.288
recharged and ready to fight.

1254
01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.956
- My uncle.
- Hey, where have you been?

1255
01:10:27.988 --> 01:10:30.424
My uncle Aaron,
he's the Prowler.

1256
01:10:30.457 --> 01:10:31.409
Slow down, Miles.

1257
01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:32.360
He works for Kingpin.

1258
01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.962
He tried to kill me!

1259
01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:35.764
This is a pretty hard-core
origin story.

1260
01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:37.832
It's okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

1261
01:10:37.865 --> 01:10:39.384
Were you followed?

1262
01:10:39.385 --> 01:10:40.903
No, I don't think so.

1263
01:10:49.711 --> 01:10:51.630
Cute place. Real homey.

1264
01:10:51.631 --> 01:10:53.548
Oh, great. It's Liv.

1265
01:10:53.581 --> 01:10:55.583
I guess I was followed.

1266
01:10:55.617 --> 01:10:56.752
Oh, no.

1267
01:10:56.784 --> 01:10:58.452
Get out of here, kid.

1268
01:10:58.485 --> 01:11:02.823
You messed up bigtime, kid.
Very sloppy.

1269
01:11:04.958 --> 01:11:08.063
Let me guess. You're Scorpion.
Well, we're the Spider gang.

1270
01:11:08.095 --> 01:11:10.331
Would you mind
taking this outside?

1271
01:11:10.364 --> 01:11:13.367
We don't pick the ballroom,
we just dance.

1272
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.037
Ooh, I think
I'll be taking that.

1273
01:11:19.606 --> 01:11:22.810
<i>Stand, ni�ito, dale.
Prep�rate a morir.</i>

1274
01:11:23.744 --> 01:11:24.979
Man, stupid pillows.

1275
01:11:43.631 --> 01:11:46.101
I said, take it outside!

1276
01:11:46.134 --> 01:11:47.536
I got it!

1277
01:11:59.546 --> 01:12:02.083
I got this, buddy.
Leave the kid alone!

1278
01:12:05.686 --> 01:12:06.822
No, no, no! No!

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:33.748
Yeah. On my way.

1283
01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:44.993
Give me that thing.

1284
01:12:45.025 --> 01:12:48.363
Don't be stupid, kid.
Hand it over, now!

1285
01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.717
Nowhere left to run.

1286
01:13:13.688 --> 01:13:15.590
Miles?

1287
01:13:15.622 --> 01:13:16.724

1289

1295

Uncle Aaron.

1296

This is my fault.

No, Miles.

1298

I'm sorry.

1299
01:14:45.813 --> 01:14:48.016
I wanted you to look up to me.

1300
01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:52.621
I let you down, man.
I let you down.

1301
01:14:56.157 --> 01:14:59.194
You're the best

1302
01:14:59.226 --> 01:15:01.229
You're on your way.

Turn around.

All units.

1311
01:16:17.872 --> 01:16:20.775
I want an APB

1312
01:16:50.671 --> 01:16:51.939
Hey, bud.

1313
01:16:53.306 --> 01:16:54.708
You okay?

1314
01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.016
We've all been there.
You know, for me,

1315
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.318
it was my Uncle Ben.

1316
01:17:04.851 --> 01:17:08.288
For me, it was
my Uncle Benjamin.

1317
01:17:08.322 --> 01:17:10.958
For me, it was my father.

1318
01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:13.962
For me, it was my best friend.

1319
01:17:13.994 --> 01:17:18.298
Miles, the hardest thing
about this job is

1320
01:17:18.332 --> 01:17:20.902
you can't always save everybody.

1321
01:17:20.935 --> 01:17:25.140
Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.

1322
01:17:25.172 --> 01:17:28.210
<i>Miles, we're probably the
only ones whodo understand.</i>

1323
01:17:30.811 --> 01:17:33.047

1333
01:18:02.476 --> 01:18:03.778
Bye, Miles.

1334
01:18:07.515 --> 01:18:09.851
Miles, I came to say goodbye.

1335
01:18:09.884 --> 01:18:11.418
We can say goodbye
at the collider.

1336
01:18:11.452 --> 01:18:13.755
You're not getting it.
You're staying here.

1337
01:18:13.787 --> 01:18:15.856
I need to be there.
So you can all go home.

1338
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:19.060
They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.

1339
01:18:19.092 --> 01:18:22.730
You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.

1340
01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:24.298
I'm doing what needs to be done.

1341
01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:26.134
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

1342
01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:28.302
What about MJ?

1343
01:18:29.537 --> 01:18:31.940
Not everything works out, kid.

1344
01:18:33.039 --> 01:18:35.476
I need the goober.

1345
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.311
Please don't make me
take it from you.

1346
01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.480
That's not fair!

1347
01:18:38.512 --> 01:18:40.347
You gotta tell them
I can do this.

1348
01:18:40.381 --> 01:18:41.983
It wasn't their decision.

1349
01:18:45.485 --> 01:18:48.989
I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!

1350
01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:50.532
Miles, you're gonna get
yourself killed.

1351
01:18:50.557 --> 01:18:52.193
But I'm ready.
I promise!

1352
01:18:55.262 --> 01:18:57.297
Then venom-strike me
right now.

1353
01:18:57.331 --> 01:19:02.069
Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.

1354
01:19:12.546 --> 01:19:16.049
Look, I know how much
you want this, kid.

1355
01:19:16.082 --> 01:19:17.952
Poor little guy.

1356
01:19:21.521 --> 01:19:23.824
But you don't have it yet.

1357
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:30.499
I'm sorry.

1358
01:19:31.998 --> 01:19:34.168
When will I know I'm ready?

1359
01:19:35.869 --> 01:19:38.439
You won't.
It's a leap of faith.

1360
01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:40.541
That's all it is, Miles.

1361
01:19:40.574 --> 01:19:43.077
A leap of faith.

1362
01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:26.087
Miles.

1363
01:20:26.119 --> 01:20:27.956
Miles, it's your dad.

1364
01:20:28.956 --> 01:20:31.025
Please open the door.

1365
01:20:32.426 --> 01:20:35.263
Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.

1366
01:20:37.131 --> 01:20:41.235
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.

1367
01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.538
Look, can we talk for a minute?

1368
01:20:45.305 --> 01:20:47.174
Something...

1369
01:20:49.076 --> 01:20:51.078
Something happened to...

1370
01:20:53.914 --> 01:20:57.319
Look, sometimes
people drift apart, Miles.

1371
01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:02.923
And I don't want that
to happen to us, okay?

1372
01:21:02.957 --> 01:21:05.226
I know I don't always do
what you need me to do

1373
01:21:05.259 --> 01:21:07.596
or say what you need me to say.

1374
01:21:09.697 --> 01:21:15.470
I see this spark in you. It's
amazing. It's why I push you.

1375
01:21:15.502 --> 01:21:17.471
But it's yours.

1376

Whatever you choose to do
with it, you'll be great.

Look, call me

1435
01:26:02.422 --> 01:26:04.791
I've been there.
You gotta move on, buddy.

1436
01:26:04.824 --> 01:26:07.194
It will take one second.
Let me just... Oh!

1437
01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.729
Hello.

1438
01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.230
Oh, wow.

1439
01:26:10.264 --> 01:26:12.333
Um...
I just wondered

1440
01:26:12.365 --> 01:26:14.469
if we could have some more
bread at table 12.

1441
01:26:15.469 --> 01:26:16.570
Yeah.

1442
01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:21.309
I'm just...
I'm really sorry.

1443
01:26:21.341 --> 01:26:24.377
Oh! Don't be sorry.
It's just bread.

1444
01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:26.814
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

1445
01:26:26.846 --> 01:26:27.631
Mm-hmm.

1446
01:26:27.632 --> 01:26:28.416
I didn't even try.

1447
01:26:28.448 --> 01:26:30.951
That's fine. You know,
I should really get going.

1448
01:26:30.984 --> 01:26:33.286
I know I could do better

1449
01:26:33.319 --> 01:26:34.889
if I just had another chance

1450
01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:40.427
to give you the bread
that you deserve.

1451
01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.729
Are you okay?

1452
01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:43.697
We'll take care of
that bread right now.

1453
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.800
Well, it's been nice
talking to you.

1454
01:26:45.832 --> 01:26:48.768
For you, they should fill this
place up with fresh bread.

1455
01:26:48.801 --> 01:26:50.136
You all right, man?

1456
01:26:50.137 --> 01:26:51.471
Oh, yeah. Totally.

1457
01:26:51.505 --> 01:26:53.541
Good, 'cause we are not
getting any bread.

1458
01:26:55.509 --> 01:26:57.345
I'm just sorry
my family can't see

1459
01:26:57.377 --> 01:26:58.979
what we're doing here tonight.

1460
01:27:07.287 --> 01:27:10.824
<i>Initializing
primary ignition sequence.</i>

1461
01:27:15.595 --> 01:27:16.964
Sleep.

1462
01:27:22.836 --> 01:27:24.572
Start the sequence.

1463
01:27:24.604 --> 01:27:27.340
Uploading Vanessa Fisk
and Richard Fisk DNA sequence.

1464
01:27:27.373 --> 01:27:29.943
Beginning scan
for dimensional matches.

1465
01:27:36.082 --> 01:27:40.720
<i>Secondary ignition in
five, four,</i>

1466
01:27:40.753 --> 01:27:45.292
<i>three, two, one.</i>

1467
01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.912
Peter, you don't have to stay
behind. I can do it.

1468
01:28:04.944 --> 01:28:06.613
It's okay.

1469
01:28:06.646 --> 01:28:08.783
I've made up my mind.

1470
01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:15.389
I'll put the goober in
and take over the beam.

1471
01:28:15.421 --> 01:28:18.458
After you're gone,
I'll blow it up.

1472
01:28:18.492 --> 01:28:19.594
Good luck, guys.

1473
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:24.998
They know we're here.

1474
01:28:32.706 --> 01:28:35.576
Nice to see you again, Peter.

1475
01:28:41.614 --> 01:28:43.650
<i>I got you covered!</i>

1476
01:28:43.684 --> 01:28:45.619
These guys are the pits.

1477
01:28:52.926 --> 01:28:54.762
Why is this always difficult?

1478
01:28:54.795 --> 01:28:57.398
Where you going, Peter?

1479
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:58.965
Any last words?

1480
01:28:58.998 --> 01:29:02.001
Can I get a minute to think
about it? You have a pen?

1481
01:29:02.034 --> 01:29:04.538
Goodbye, Peter Parker.

1482
01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:16.384
Who did that?!

1483
01:29:22.655 --> 01:29:23.773
Miles?

1484
01:29:23.774 --> 01:29:24.891
Spider-Man?

1485
01:29:24.925 --> 01:29:27.895
Wow, Miles. You're
doing it on command!

1486
01:29:27.927 --> 01:29:29.430
It's about time, right?

1487
01:29:29.462 --> 01:29:30.630
Look who's here!

1488
01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:31.798
You figured it out.

1489
01:29:31.832 --> 01:29:33.534
I love you!
I am so proud of you!

1490
01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.503
Do I want kids?

1491
01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:38.573
Oh, yeah, I forgot about her.

1492
01:29:40.207 --> 01:29:41.976
Well, that doesn't look
promising.

1493
01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:43.778
No, it doesn't.

1494
01:29:49.682 --> 01:29:52.153
<i>- I've got genetic matches.
- Hold on.</i>

1495
01:29:52.185 --> 01:29:53.554
It's too risky.

1496
01:29:53.587 --> 01:29:54.955
Shut up and turn it up.

1497
01:29:54.988 --> 01:29:55.906
On your left!

1498
01:29:55.907 --> 01:29:56.824
On your right!

1499
01:29:56.856 --> 01:29:59.193
- I got five o'clock!
- Three o'clock! Two o'clock!

1500
01:29:59.225 --> 01:30:01.695
Every direction!

1501
01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.865
Get to a shelter.
I'll be right there.

1502
01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:09.670
I tried the school,
but I can't get through.

1503
01:30:23.115 --> 01:30:25.085
Guys, are you seeing this?

1504
01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.823
Looks like our dimensions
are coming to us.

1505
01:30:28.855 --> 01:30:31.192
Does look cool though, right?

1506
01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:33.161
We gotta get back up there.

1507
01:30:35.595 --> 01:30:36.863
Is that all you got?

1508
01:30:36.896 --> 01:30:38.865
You gonna fight
or you just bumping gums?

1509
01:30:38.899 --> 01:30:40.668
You hard-boiled
turtle slapper!

1510
01:31:02.154 --> 01:31:05.725
What are you,
some kind of silly cartoon?

1511
01:31:05.759 --> 01:31:07.895
You got a problem with cartoons?

1512
01:31:13.699 --> 01:31:15.202
Blammo!

1513
01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:21.575
Aww...

1514
01:31:21.608 --> 01:31:24.110
Did that feel like a cartoon?

1515
01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:38.860
Gwen!

1516
01:31:47.801 --> 01:31:48.969
I like your suit.

1517
01:31:49.002 --> 01:31:50.671
Thanks. I made it myself.

1518
01:31:50.703 --> 01:31:54.509
That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!

1519
01:32:08.087 --> 01:32:10.623
Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.

1520
01:32:14.261 --> 01:32:15.996
All right.
Never mind.

1521
01:32:16.029 --> 01:32:17.164
Let's end this thing.

1522
01:32:17.197 --> 01:32:18.599
Guys, I got it.

1523
01:32:18.631 --> 01:32:20.233
I'll go. I'm the one
with the goo...

1524
01:32:21.734 --> 01:32:23.069
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1525
01:32:23.103 --> 01:32:26.273
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

1526
01:32:30.944 --> 01:32:31.529
Miles!

1527
01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:32.113
Be careful!

1528
01:32:45.859 --> 01:32:47.094
That was crazy.

1529
01:32:47.127 --> 01:32:49.029
We taught him that, right?

1530
01:32:49.061 --> 01:32:51.832
I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.

1531
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.118
You okay?

1532
01:33:12.752 --> 01:33:14.154
Come on.

1533
01:33:20.894 --> 01:33:23.731
Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!

1534
01:33:25.731 --> 01:33:28.801
<i>Alert! Quantum polarity
has been reversed.</i>

1535
01:33:33.939 --> 01:33:35.675
Guess this is it.

1536
01:33:35.708 --> 01:33:39.078
Well, nice to know
we're not alone.

1537
01:33:39.112 --> 01:33:40.981
Right?

1538
01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:42.850
Yeah.

1539
01:33:42.882 --> 01:33:45.284
I got the portal open.
You first, Peni.

1540
01:33:45.318 --> 01:33:47.387
Thank you, Miles.

1541
01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.657
From both of us.

1542
01:33:52.725 --> 01:33:55.962
I, uh, love you all.

1543
01:33:55.996 --> 01:33:58.899
I'm taking this cube thing
with me.

1544
01:33:58.931 --> 01:34:00.967
I don't understand it.

1545
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:02.636
But I will.

1546
01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:08.075
I want you to have this.

1547
01:34:08.108 --> 01:34:09.944
It'll fit in your pocket.

1548
01:34:11.344 --> 01:34:13.279
That's all, folks.

1549
01:34:13.313 --> 01:34:16.182
Is he allowed to say that,
legally?

1550
01:34:19.819 --> 01:34:21.889
Do I get to like the hairdo now?

1551
01:34:23.256 --> 01:34:25.092
You know I'm older than you.

1552
01:34:25.125 --> 01:34:28.429
15 months, but it's pretty
significant if you ask me.

1553
01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:32.232
Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?

1554
01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.036
Nice.

1555
01:34:37.436 --> 01:34:39.039
Friends?

1556
01:34:40.439 --> 01:34:41.942
Friends.

1557
01:34:41.975 --> 01:34:43.010
Cool.

1558
01:34:43.042 --> 01:34:45.045
See you around,
Spider-Man.

1559
01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:57.123
Your turn.

1560
01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:01.095
Yeah, yeah. Right.

1561
01:35:04.463 --> 01:35:06.867
You're not going anywhere!

1562
01:35:06.899 --> 01:35:09.335
I'll hold him off.
You shut this down.

1563
01:35:09.368 --> 01:35:11.037
Peter, that wasn't the deal!

1564
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:14.341
Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!

1565
01:35:18.011 --> 01:35:19.263
What are you doing?

1566
01:35:19.264 --> 01:35:20.514
You gotta go home!

1567
01:35:20.546 --> 01:35:23.483
This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.

1568
01:35:23.516 --> 01:35:25.251
Neither can I.

1569
01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.889
It's okay.

1570
01:35:29.789 --> 01:35:31.257
Yeah, it is okay.

1571
01:35:35.462 --> 01:35:37.965
You gotta go home, man.

1572
01:35:39.431 --> 01:35:42.135
How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?

1573
01:35:42.168 --> 01:35:43.369
You won't.

1574
01:35:44.871 --> 01:35:46.306
Right.

1575
01:35:46.338 --> 01:35:48.274
It's a leap of faith.

1576
01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:59.386
Not bad, kid.

1577
01:36:08.561 --> 01:36:09.863
Kingpin!

1578
01:36:23.409 --> 01:36:24.577
Nope!

1579
01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:26.846
Sorry! That's cheating.

1580
01:36:28.981 --> 01:36:30.117
<i>Adi�s.</i>

1581
01:36:38.457 --> 01:36:40.460
I gotta get to that button.

1582
01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:46.934
Oh, no.

1583
01:36:46.966 --> 01:36:49.302
Not so easy doing it
on your own, is it?

1584
01:36:52.939 --> 01:36:55.542
I can't wait to kill
one more Spider-Man.

1585
01:36:58.944 --> 01:36:59.962
Where am I?

1586
01:36:59.963 --> 01:37:00.980
What?

1587
01:37:01.014 --> 01:37:02.583
Wilson?

1588
01:37:02.615 --> 01:37:04.117
Is this what you want, man?

1589
01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.618
What are you doing?

1590
01:37:05.652 --> 01:37:08.055
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1591
01:37:08.087 --> 01:37:09.322
What are we doing here?

1592
01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:10.556
I don't know, Richard.

1593
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:11.891
It's me. You know me.

1594
01:37:13.025 --> 01:37:14.560
We're leaving now.

1595
01:37:14.594 --> 01:37:16.896
Don't go.

1596
01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:18.365
Stay with me.

1597
01:37:18.398 --> 01:37:20.134
Please!

1598
01:37:25.372 --> 01:37:28.242
You're not stopping this.
Not today.

1599
01:37:28.274 --> 01:37:30.911
I am stopping this.
Right now!

1600
01:37:39.085 --> 01:37:41.322
I need backup.

1601
01:38:18.457 --> 01:38:20.226
Come on.

1602
01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:31.171
The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.

1603
01:38:33.573 --> 01:38:35.276
You're nothing!

1604
01:38:41.314 --> 01:38:43.550
You took my family.

1605
01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:51.491
And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.

1606
01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:13.013
Get up, Spider-Man.

1607
01:39:15.347 --> 01:39:17.984
Get up! Come on!

1608
01:39:24.524 --> 01:39:28.061
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1609
01:39:39.204 --> 01:39:42.341
I'll always have my family.

1610
01:39:42.375 --> 01:39:44.110
You ever hear of
the shoulder touch?

1611
01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:46.313
What?

1612
01:39:50.483 --> 01:39:51.618
Hey.

1613
01:40:01.226 --> 01:40:05.431
Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!

1614
01:41:54.407 --> 01:41:57.377
Miles? Miles? Are you okay?

1615
01:41:57.409 --> 01:41:58.511
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

1616
01:41:59.479 --> 01:42:00.713
You're probably busy...

1617
01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:02.749
<i>No! I can talk,
I can talk.</i>

1618
01:42:02.782 --> 01:42:06.653
<i>Look, so I
came by earlier because...</i>

1619
01:42:07.886 --> 01:42:09.105
Your uncle...

1620
01:42:09.106 --> 01:42:10.323
I know, Dad.

1621
01:42:11.623 --> 01:42:13.159
I am so sorry.

1622
01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:15.228
Yeah.

1623
01:42:15.261 --> 01:42:16.696
Do you know who did it?

1624
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:18.532
I thought I did.

1625
01:42:18.564 --> 01:42:20.666
But I was wrong.

1626
01:42:20.699 --> 01:42:24.237
Look, Miles,
what I said at the door,

1627
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:25.639
it wasn't just talk.

1628
01:42:27.539 --> 01:42:29.676
Look, you know, I was thinking

1629
01:42:29.708 --> 01:42:32.378
maybe we could find a nice wall,

1630
01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:35.515
privately owned,
like at the police station,

1631
01:42:35.547 --> 01:42:41.547
and you could "throw up"
some of your art.

1632
01:42:41.753 --> 01:42:44.256
Man, I'm bad at this.

1633
01:42:44.289 --> 01:42:47.394
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1634
01:42:47.426 --> 01:42:50.329
Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!

1635
01:42:50.363 --> 01:42:51.798
Officer.

1636
01:42:51.799 --> 01:42:53.233
Spider-Man!

1637
01:42:53.265 --> 01:42:55.534
Listen, down there, that was...

1638
01:42:55.568 --> 01:42:57.270
I mean, I owe you...

1639
01:42:57.302 --> 01:42:59.506
Okay!

1640
01:43:07.279 --> 01:43:09.349
I look forward
to workin' with you.

1641
01:43:09.381 --> 01:43:11.784
Yeah, me, too. I guess.

1642
01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:14.954
I don't approve of your methods,

1643
01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:18.425
but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.

1644
01:43:18.457 --> 01:43:21.393
Thank you for
your bravery tonight.

1645
01:43:21.426 --> 01:43:22.628
I love you.

1646
01:43:22.662 --> 01:43:24.231
Wait, what?

1647
01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:25.364
And look behind you!

1648
01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.545
All right. Cool. Yeah.

1649
01:43:38.578 --> 01:43:39.946
Thanks,
Spider-Man.

1650
01:43:39.979 --> 01:43:41.780
<i>Spider-Man,
a su servicio. Thank you.</i>

1651
01:43:41.814 --> 01:43:43.416
Hey, man. What's up,
little man?

1652
01:43:43.448 --> 01:43:44.617
New Spider-Man.

1653
01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:45.892
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm the new Spider-Man.

1654
01:43:45.917 --> 01:43:47.453
Check it out.

1655
01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:48.788
Whoa!

1656
01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.457
That was part of the move.

1657
01:43:51.490 --> 01:43:54.527
<i>Okay, let's do this
one last time, yeah?</i>

1658
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.029
<i>For real this time. This is it.</i>

1659
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:57.697
<i>My name is Miles Morales.</i>

1660
01:43:57.729 --> 01:43:59.798
<i>I was bitten by
a radioactive spider.</i>

1661
01:43:59.832 --> 01:44:01.434
<i>And for like two days,</i>

1662
01:44:01.466 --> 01:44:03.435
<i>I've been
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

1663
01:44:03.469 --> 01:44:04.938
<i>I think you know the rest.</i>

1664
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:06.439
<i>I finished my essay.</i>

1665
01:44:07.472 --> 01:44:09.576
<i>Saved a bunch of people.</i>

1666
01:44:11.043 --> 01:44:12.912
<i>Got hit by a drone.</i>

1667
01:44:12.944 --> 01:44:14.648
<i>I did this with my dad.</i>

1668
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:18.252
<i>Met my roommate. Finally.</i>

1669
01:44:20.019 --> 01:44:23.356
<i>Slapped a sticker where
my dad's never gonna find it.</i>

1670
01:44:23.389 --> 01:44:25.025
<i>And when I feel alone,</i>

1671
01:44:25.057 --> 01:44:27.728
<i>like no one understands
what I'm going through,</i>

1672
01:44:29.362 --> 01:44:31.331
<i>I remember my friends
who get it.</i>

1673
01:44:37.869 --> 01:44:40.506
<i>I never thought I'd be able
to do any of this stuff.</i>

1674
01:44:40.539 --> 01:44:42.042
<i>But I can.</i>

1675
01:44:43.643 --> 01:44:45.545
<i>Anyone can wear the mask.</i>

1676
01:44:46.878 --> 01:44:49.048
<i>You could wear the mask.</i>

1677
01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:53.987
<i>If you didn't know that before,
I hope you do now.</i>

1678
01:45:02.694 --> 01:45:03.796
<i>'Cause I'm Spider-Man.</i>

1679
01:45:05.797 --> 01:45:08.534
<i>And I'm not the only one.</i>

1680
01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:10.070
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

1681
01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:12.372
<i>� Needless to say
I keep her in check �</i>

1682
01:45:12.404 --> 01:45:14.873

Nevertheless �</i>

1683
01:45:14.907 --> 01:45:17.711
<i>� Callin' it quits now
Baby, I'm a wreck... �</i>

1684
01:45:17.743 --> 01:45:21.014
Miles. Miles!

1685
01:45:21.046 --> 01:45:22.815
You got a minute?

1686
01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:33.993
<i>� Stepped out of my zone �</i>

1687

1688
01:45:35.927 --> 01:45:37.796
<i>� And figure it out on my own �</i>

1689
01:45:37.829 --> 01:45:39.798
<i>� And I know what
I really want now �</i>

01:54:18.250 --> 01:54:21.554
<i>� Oh, Spidey-bells Spidey-bells �</i>

1897
01:54:21.587 --> 01:54:23.489
<i>� Swinging through Midtown �</i>

1898
01:54:23.521 --> 01:54:25.291
<i>� Oh, what fun to sling a web �</i>

1899
01:54:25.323 --> 01:54:27.393
<i>� And take the bad guys down �</i>

1900
01:54:27.426 --> 01:54:29.295
<i>� Spidey-bells, Spidey-bells �</i>

1901
01:54:29.328 --> 01:54:31.063
<i>� Quipping all the time �</i>

1902
01:54:31.095 --> 01:54:32.898
<i>� Oh, what fun To swing around �</i>

1903
01:54:32.931 --> 01:54:35.001
<i>� New York
While fighting crime �</i>

1904
01:54:35.033 --> 01:54:37.002
<i>� Swinging through The streets �</i>

1905
01:54:37.036 --> 01:54:38.604
<i>� On a web of spider silk �</i>

1906
01:54:38.636 --> 01:54:40.505
<i>� Kicking all the butts �</i>

1907
01:54:40.538 --> 01:54:42.440
<i>� Of villains and their ilk �</i>

1908
01:54:42.474 --> 01:54:44.543
<i>� Bombs from Goblins fling
Fling �</i>

1909
01:54:44.576 --> 01:54:46.345
<i>� Pumpkins blooming bright
Bright �</i>

1910
01:54:46.377 --> 01:54:48.146
<i>� How hard it is
To consistently bring �</i>

1911
01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:49.615
<i>� Peace to New York all night �</i>

1912
01:54:49.648 --> 01:54:52.018
<i>� Oh, Spidey-bells
Might be swell �</i>

1913
01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:54.053
<i>� To do more than fight crime �</i>

1914
01:54:54.086 --> 01:54:56.923
<i>� I got a lot of qualities
That don't get much airtime �</i>

1915
01:54:56.956 --> 01:54:59.525
<i>� I can sing, I can dance
I tell jokes, I act �</i>

1916
01:54:59.557 --> 01:55:01.661
<i>� I get big, big, big deal �</i>

1917
01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:03.429
<i>� If my agent called me back �</i>

1918
01:55:05.530 --> 01:55:09.467
<i>� Why did I agree �</i>

1919
01:55:09.501 --> 01:55:14.105
<i>� To do this stupid song? �</i>

1920
01:55:14.139 --> 01:55:17.143
<i>� I have a degree �</i>

1921
01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:21.614
<i>� In chemical engineering �</i>

1922
01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:31.990
You're a bit late.

1923
01:55:32.024 --> 01:55:33.400
We can't all be everywhere at once.

1924
01:55:33.425 --> 01:55:35.226
Little text might've been nice.

1925
01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:37.004
I was gone for less than
two hours. What happened?

1926
01:55:37.029 --> 01:55:39.065
Okay.
I know what it looks like.

1927
01:55:39.097 --> 01:55:40.315
But here's the good news.

1928
01:55:40.316 --> 01:55:41.533
Oh, here we go.

1929
01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:43.469
<i>The multiversedidn't collapse.</i>

1930
01:55:43.502 --> 01:55:44.370
Oh, cool!

1931
01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:45.237
Little touch and go.

1932
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:46.739
But it worked out.

1933
01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:48.182
Great story.
Did you finish the goober?

1934
01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:49.608
It's not a goober.
It's a gizmo.

1935
01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.143
Do you always have to call me out?

1936
01:55:51.176 --> 01:55:52.352
It's just really frustrating
and bums me out.

1937
01:55:52.377 --> 01:55:53.679
Don't get excited, Miguel.

1938
01:55:53.712 --> 01:55:55.188
- It's just a prototype.
- Not excited.

1939
01:55:55.213 --> 01:55:56.456
But you could be the first person

1940
01:55:56.481 --> 01:55:58.417
to make an autonomous
multiverse jump.

1941
01:55:58.449 --> 01:55:59.719
Or the last.

1942
01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.554
So we're just gonna roll
the dice on this?

1943
01:56:01.587 --> 01:56:04.423
So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?

1944
01:56:04.456 --> 01:56:07.360
Let's start at the beginning
one last time.

1945
01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:09.595
Earth '67.

1946
01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:12.899
Whoa!

1947
01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:13.666
What the...?

1948
01:56:13.698 --> 01:56:15.300
I'm Spider-Man.

1949
01:56:15.333 --> 01:56:16.677
- I need you to come with me.
- Who the heck are you?

1950
01:56:16.702 --> 01:56:19.204
I just told you...
Listen. I'm from the future.

1951
01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:20.213
How dare you point at me!

1952
01:56:20.238 --> 01:56:21.474
You were pointing first.

1953
01:56:21.506 --> 01:56:22.758
It's rude to point.

1954
01:56:22.759 --> 01:56:24.009
<i>You're being very rude.</i>

1955
01:56:24.042 --> 01:56:26.045
Which one pointed first?

1956
01:56:26.078 --> 01:56:28.014
Spider-Man pointed first.
Obviously.

1957
01:56:28.046 --> 01:56:29.722
- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.

1958
01:56:29.747 --> 01:56:31.449
Look at your finger.

1959
01:56:31.483 --> 01:56:32.759
I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.

1960
01:56:32.784 --> 01:56:34.386
You haven't seen pointing.

1961
01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.588
You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!

1962
