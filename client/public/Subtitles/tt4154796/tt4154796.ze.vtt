00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:09.426
等一下，別射
Okay, hold on, don't shoot.

2
00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.928
-看到目標了嗎？ -嗯
- You see where you're going? - Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:13.096
好
Okay.

4
00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.181
現在想想怎麼射中
Now, let's worry about how you get there.

5
00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.434
腳得移過來
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.352
腳尖向這邊
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.271
屁股，挺胸
Your hips here.

8
00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.814
好了嗎？
Okay?

9
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:24.941
-看得見嗎？ -可以
- Can you see? - Yeah.

10
00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:26.109
-確定？ -嗯
- Are you sure? - Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:27.652
現在呢？看得見嗎？
How about now? Can you see now?

12
00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.070
-看不見 -這樣呢？
- No. - How about now?

13
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.323
好
All right.

14
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.993
準備，用三根手指頭
Ready? Three fingers.

15
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.870
漂亮
Nice!

16
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.956
投得真棒，孩子
Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.207
接住
Here you go.

18
00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.626
你們要美乃滋還是芥末醬？
Hey, you guys want mayo? Or mustard?

19
00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.253
還是都要？
Or both?

20
00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.505
哪有人熱狗加美乃滋？
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

21
00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:48.631
妳弟弟吧
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:50.967
兩份加芥末醬，謝了，媽媽
Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:51.968
知道了
Got it!

24
00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.054
奈特，美乃滋還是芥末醬？
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.889
番茄醬呢？
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.266
好，也有番茄醬
Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.642
注意手肘
Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:03.688
好眼力
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.482
去拔箭
Go get your arrow.

30
00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:09.694
大家過來
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.072
練習夠了，吃東西
Enough practice. Soup's on!

32
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.281
好
All right.

33
00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.824
馬上來，我們餓了
We're coming. We're hungry.

34
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.369
萊拉，走吧
Lila, let's go.

35
00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.664
萊拉？
Lila?

36
00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.585
親愛的？
Honey?

37
00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:30.632
老婆？
Hey, babe?

38
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

39
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.518
老婆？
Babe?

40
00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:44.771
老婆？
Babe?

41
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:47.649
兒子！
Boys!

42
00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.402
兒子！
Boys!

43
00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:53.905
蘿拉！
Laura!

44
00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:38.950
妳不必這樣
You don't need to do that.

45
00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.162
只要保持不動就好
Because, uh, you're just holding the position.

46
00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:44.372
對
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:45.665
差一點
That was close.

48
00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.294
得分，現在一比一
That's a goal. We are now one a piece.

49
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.837
我想再試試看
I would like to try again.

50
00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.550
我們平手，緊張嗎？
We're tied up. Feel the tension?

51
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.260
好玩
It's fun.

52
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.429
爛死了，現在妳有機會贏
That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.

53
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.681
妳贏了
And you've won.

54
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.933
恭喜
Congratulations.

55
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.226
公平競爭
Fair game.

56
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:07.937
可敬的對手
Good sport.

57
00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.315
開心嗎？
You have fun?

58
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.069
很好玩
It was fun.

59
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.218
啟動了嗎？
This thing on?

60
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.389
波茲小姐，小辣椒
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

61
00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.434
如果妳找到這段錄影
If you find this recording...

62
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.270
別放到社群媒體上
don't post it on social media.

63
00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.147
它會讓人大飆淚
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

64
00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.234
不知道妳會不會看到這些影片
I don't know if you're ever gonna see these.

65
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.444
不知道妳是否還…
I don't even know if you're still...

66
00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.863
天啊，希望如此
Oh, God, I hope so.

67
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.950
今天是第21天
Today's day 21.

68
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.369
不，第22天
No, uh, 22.

69
00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.580
要不是因為盯著無垠太空
You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror...

70
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:12.210
產生存在恐懼，我今天會好過點
of staring into the literal void of space, I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.

71
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:15.422
感染快好了，多虧裡面那個藍臉魔王
Infection's run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.

72
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.590
妳會很喜歡她的
Oh, you'd love her.

73
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.175
非常務實
Very practical.

74
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.720
只有一點虐待狂
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

75
00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.810
燃料電池在戰役中受損
So, the fuel cells were cracked during battle...

76
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.146
我們設法反轉離子電荷
and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge...

77
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.024
多爭取了48小時飛行時間
and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.

78
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.154
但現在陷入絕境
Uh, but it's now dead in the water.

79
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.824
最近的7-11在一千光年以外
Thousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven.

80
00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.703
氧氣明早會用完
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...

81
00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:49.873
就這樣了
and that'll be it.

82
00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:56.254
小辣椒，我說過不再有驚人之舉
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

83
00:04:56.421 --> 00:05:00.008
但我真的希望再做最後一次
but I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

84
00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.135
可是看起來…
But it looks like...

85
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.095
妳也知道現在的情況
Well, you know what it looks like.

86
00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.349
不要難過
Don't feel bad about this.

87
00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.310
如果妳悲痛個幾星期
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...

88
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:14.189
然後帶著強烈罪惡感過日子…
and then move on with enormous guilt...

89
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.365
我應該躺一下，閉目養神
I should probably lie down for a minute. Go rest my eyes.

90
00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.911
請妳瞭解
Please know...

91
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.707
等我慢慢睡著，就會像最近的每個夜晚
when I drift off, it'll be like every night lately.

92
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.877
我很好，好得不得了
I'm fine. Totally fine.

93
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.837
我常夢見妳
I dream about you.

94
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.007
自始至終都是妳
Because it's always you.

95
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.753
我阻止不了他
Couldn't stop him.

96
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:05.920
我也沒辦法
Neither could I.

97
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.255
等一下
Hang on.

98
00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.259
我失去了那小子
I lost the kid.

99
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.388
東尼，我們輸了
Tony, we lost.

100
00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:18.683
是不是…
Is, uh...?

101
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.311
我的天啊
- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!

102
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.355
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

103
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.487
沒事
It's okay.

104
00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.204
薩諾斯來到地球已經23天
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

105
00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.372
（史蒂芬史傳奇，失蹤）

106
00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:41.539
（山姆威爾森，失蹤）

107
00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:42.957
各國政府分崩離析
World governments are

108
00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.125
（汪達麥西莫夫，失蹤）
in pieces.

109
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.460
還在運作的政府
The parts that are still working...

110
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.294
（史考特朗恩，失蹤）
The parts that are still working...

111
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:49.964
正試圖統計人數，看來他…
...are trying to take a census and it looks like he did...

112
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.302
他說到做到
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.

113
00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:55.470
薩諾斯殲滅了…
Thanos wiped out...

114
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.639
（尼克福瑞，失蹤）

115
00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:01.142
世上一半的生物
...50% of all living creatures.

116
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.399
他現在在哪裡？
Where is he now? Where?

117
00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.275
不知道
We don't know.

118
00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.529
他打開一個入口，走了進去
He just opened a portal and walked through.

119
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.199
他怎麼了？
What's wrong with him?

120
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.244
他很火大
Oh, he's pissed.

121
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:20.745
覺得自己失敗了
He thinks he failed.

122
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.206
當然是那樣沒錯
Which, of course, he did...

123
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.500
但大家不都如此嗎？
but there's a lot of that going around, ain't there?

124
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.211
說真的，我剛剛還以為你是填充玩具
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

125
00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.000
也許我是
Maybe I am.

126
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.339
我們找了薩諾斯三星期
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.

127
00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.508
深度太空掃描
Deep space scans...

128
00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.719
還有衛星，一無所獲
and satellites, and we got nothing.

129
00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:38.513
東尼，你對抗過他
Tony, you fought him.

130
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.597
誰告訴你的？
Who told you that?

131
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.307
我沒有
I didn't fight him.

132
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.059
他徹底擊垮我
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

133
00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.645
那個紐約魔術師奉上寶石
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.

134
00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.148
沒有對抗，他根本打不垮
That's what happened. There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable.

135
00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.026
他有給你線索或座標嗎？
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

136
00:10:51.748 --> 00:10:53.281
Uh...

137
00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.530
幾年前我就料到了
I saw this coming a few years back.

138
00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.323
我看到一個景象，卻不願相信
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

139
00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.284
以為自己在作夢
Thought I was dreaming.

140
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:00.452
東尼，我需要你專注點
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

141
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.370
當時我需要你
And I needed you.

142
00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:03.580
過去式
As in, past tense.

143
00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:07.000
那比你需要的更重要，太遲了
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.

144
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.293
抱歉
Sorry.

145
00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.963
我需要什麼呢？刮鬍子
You know what I need? I need a shave.

146
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.133
我記得告訴你們…
And I believe I remember telling all youse...

147
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.176
東尼…
Tony, Tony!

148
00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:21.639
無論死活，我們需要一套全球防衛機制
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed was a suit of armour around the world.

149
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:25.435
記得嗎？無論它是否影響我們寶貴的自由
Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.

150
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.811
那才是我們需要的
That's what we needed.

151
00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.063
結果無效，是吧？
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

152
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.647
我說我們會輸
I said we'd lose.

153
00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.983
你說要輸也是一起輸
You said, "We'll do that together, too."

154
00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.610
結果呢，隊長？
And guess what, Cap?

155
00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.070
我們輸了
We lost.

156
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.529
你卻不在場
And you weren't there.

157
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.282
我們就是這德行
But that's what we do, right?

158
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.202
事後只會說我們是復仇者聯盟
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers."

159
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.329
我們是復仇者聯盟，不是預防者聯盟
We're the "Avengers," not the "Pre-vengers."

160
00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:45.497
-好啦 -對吧？
- Okay. - Right?

161
00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:46.873
你表達得很清楚了，坐下
You made your point. Just sit down, okay?

162
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.999
不，我要講重點了
Okay. No, no, here's my point. You know what?

163
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:49.542
-她很厲害 -你病了，坐下
- She's great by the way. - Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

164
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.336
我們需要妳，妳是新血
We need you. You're new blood.

165
00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:54.339
我們都是老屁股，我沒東西給你，隊長
Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap.

166
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:55.799
我沒有座標
I got no coordinates...

167
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.718
沒線索，沒策略，沒選擇
no clues, no strategies, no options.

168
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.595
零，鴨蛋，屁都沒有
Zero. Zip. Nada.

169
00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.514
沒有信任，騙子
No trust, liar.

170
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.311
拿去
Here, take this.

171
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.605
找到他，戴上去
You find him, you put that on...

172
00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:12.607
躲起來
you hide.

173
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.610
-東尼 -我很好
- Tony! - I'm fine.

174
00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.487
讓我…
Let me...

175
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.286
布魯斯幫他打了鎮靜劑
Bruce gave him a sedative.

176
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.163
他應該今天都不會醒
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

177
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.708
你們照顧他
You guys take care of him...

178
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.418
我再帶梭爾人的仙丹回來
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.

179
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:33.003
妳要去哪？
Where are you going?

180
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.838
幹掉薩諾斯
To kill Thanos.

181
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.009
喂
Hey.

182
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.302
我們通常集體行動
You know, we usually work as a team here...

183
00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.138
其實現在士氣低落
and, uh, between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

184
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.891
太空固然是妳的戰場，但這也是我們的戰役
We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight, too.

185
00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.226
妳知道他的下落嗎？
You even know where he is?

186
00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.561
我認識的人可能知道
I know people who might.

187
00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.062
不必麻煩了
Don't bother.

188
00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.773
我能告訴你們薩諾斯在哪
I can tell you where Thanos is.

189
00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.279
薩諾斯花了很長時間使我更趨完美
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.

190
00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:03.950
他常提到他的遠大計劃
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.

191
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:07.203
我就算支離破碎，也想討好他
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.

192
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.788
我會問他
I'd ask...

193
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.000
他計畫完成後，我們會去哪裡？
where would we go once his plan was complete?

194
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.502
他的答案始終如一
And his answer was always the same.

195
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:19.716
去花園
"To the Garden."

196
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:23.094
真可愛，薩諾斯有養老計畫
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.

197
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.804
所以他在哪裡？
So, where is he?

198
00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.223
薩諾斯一彈指
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

199
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.269
地球成了一股超強電力突波的中心點
Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

200
00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.646
沒人見過那樣的奇景
No one's ever seen anything like it.

201
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.148
直到兩天前
Until two days ago...

202
00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.568
在這個星球上
on this planet.

203
00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.779
薩諾斯在那裡
Thanos is there.

204
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.199
他又運用了無限寶石
He used the stones again.

205
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:45.867
喂…
Hey, hey, hey.

206
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.244
我們人手不足
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

207
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.788
無限寶石還在他手上
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

208
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.498
我們去拿
So, let's get 'em.

209
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.041
用它們把所有人救回來
Use them to bring everyone back.

210
00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.292
就那樣？
Just like that?

211
00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.044
對，就那樣
Yeah. Just like that.

212
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.381
即便逆轉的機會微乎其微
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this...

213
00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:02.258
為了其他人，我們也該放手一搏
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

214
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:06.388
如果這麼做，如何知道結果會有所不同？
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

215
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.181
因為以前你們沒有我
Because before you didn't have me.

216
00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.225
嘿，新來的妹
Hey, new girl?

217
00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:13.103
這裡每個人都是超級英雄
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life.

218
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.897
我直接問，這段時間妳在哪裡？
And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?

219
00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:18.483
宇宙中還有其他許多星球
There are a lot of other planets in the universe.

220
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.528
可惜它們沒有你們
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

221
00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.258
這個我喜歡
I like this one.

222
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.265
我們去找那個王八蛋
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

223
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:57.397
復仇者聯盟：終局之戰

224
00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.038
好
Okay.

225
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.832
這裡誰沒上過太空？
Who here hasn't been to space?

226
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:18.335
幹嘛？
Why?

227
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.170
最好別吐在我船上
You better not throw up on my ship.

228
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:21.629
接近跳躍點，三…
Approaching jump in three...

229
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.882
二，一
two, one.

230
00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.147
我去前面偵察情況
I'll head down for recon.

231
00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.875
會成功的，史帝夫
This is gonna work, Steve.

232
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.835
我知道
I know it will.

233
00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:06.966
否則我也束手無策了
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

234
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.054
沒衛星，沒船艦，沒軍隊
No satellites. No ships. No armies.

235
00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.722
沒有任何地面防禦機制
No ground defenses of any kind.

236
00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.476
只有他
It's just him.

237
00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.853
那就夠了
And that's enough.

238
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.319
糟糕
Oh, no.

239
00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.538
它們在哪裡？
Where are they?

240
00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.374
回答問題
Answer the question.

241
00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.212
宇宙需要修正
The universe required correction.

242
00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:11.174
修正後，寶石就沒有用途
After that, the stones served no purpose...

243
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.967
只是誘惑
beyond temptation.

244
00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.095
你謀殺了數十億人
You murdered trillions!

245
00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.639
你們應該心懷感激
You should be grateful.

246
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.770
寶石在哪裡？
Where are the stones?

247
00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.313
灰飛煙滅
Gone.

248
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.564
縮小成原子
Reduced to atoms.

249
00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:28.733
兩天前你才用過它們
You used them two days ago!

250
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.112
我用寶石來摧毀寶石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

251
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.489
差點害我沒命
It nearly killed me.

252
00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:37.659
但任務完成了
But the work is done.

253
00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:40.745
總是會完成的
It always will be.

254
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.709
我是無可匹敵的
I am inevitable.

255
00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:50.380
我們徹底搜索這裡，他一定在說謊
We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!

256
00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:51.756
我父親有很多面向
My father is many things.

257
00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.718
卻不會說謊
A liar is not one of them.

258
00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.056
謝謝妳，女兒
Ah. Thank you, daughter.

259
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.853
或許我對妳太嚴厲了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

260
00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.360
什麼？
What?

261
00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.779
你做了什麼？
What did you do?

262
00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.116
這次我對準了頭
I went for the head.

263
00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:09.000
（五年後）

264
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.189
所以…
So......I, uh,

265
00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:32.357
（他們不在了，我們何去何從？）

266
00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.984
前幾天我有約會
went on a date the other day.

267
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.820
五年來頭一遭
It's the first time in five years.

268
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.322
我坐在那裡吃晚餐
You know? I'm sitting there at dinner.

269
00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:42.534
根本不知道該聊什麼
I didn't even know what to talk about.

270
00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.078
結果你們聊什麼？
What did you talk about?

271
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.915
老掉牙的話題…今非昔比
Eh, same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

272
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.167
我的工作，他的工作
My job, his job.

273
00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.045
我們多懷念大都會隊
How much we miss the Mets.

274
00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.008
接著兩人靜了下來
And then things got quiet...

275
00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:03.722
上沙拉時他哭了出來
then he cried as they were serving the salads.

276
00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.390
你呢？
What about you?

277
00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.728
我在上甜點前飆淚
I cried just before dessert.

278
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.608
我明天還會見他，所以…
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

279
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:17.527
那很棒
That's great.

280
00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:19.279
踏出第一步最難
You did the hardest part. You took the jump.

281
00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.573
你不知道結果如何
You didn't know where you were gonna come down.

282
00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:26.494
我們就是得踏出那些小小的步伐
And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take...

283
00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:30.373
努力再認真生活，尋找目標
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose.

284
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:36.212
1945年我遇見摯愛後，立刻被冷凍
I went in the ice in '45, right after I met the love of my life.

285
00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.840
70年後才醒來
Woke up 70 years later.

286
00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:44.012
日子總得過下去
You gotta move on.

287
00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.350
就是得過下去
Gotta move on.

288
00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:55.607
世界掌握在我們手中
The world is in our hands.

289
00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:57.859
交到了我們手上，各位
It's left to us, guys.

290
00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:00.236
我們必須善加利用
And we gotta do something with it.

291
00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.364
否則…
Otherwise...

292
00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.992
薩諾斯該殺光我們才對
Thanos should've killed all of us.

293
00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:13.500
（舊金山）

294
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:20.965
（任你放自助倉庫）

295
00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:09.264
搞什麼？
What the hell?

296
00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:22.902
荷普？
Hope?

297
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:25.488
（保全）

298
00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:35.040
（救命！）

299
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.385
（失蹤）

300
00:23:56.102 --> 00:23:57.103
小朋友！
Kid!

301
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.313
喂，小朋友
Hey, kid!

302
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.861
這裡發生什麼事？
What the hell happened here?

303
00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:27.717
（消逝者）

304
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:38.311
天啊
Oh, my God!

305
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:42.607
拜託
Oh, please!

306
00:24:42.774 --> 00:24:44.317
拜託…
Please, please!

307
00:24:44.484 --> 00:24:46.486
不…
No, no, no. No.

308
00:24:47.946 --> 00:24:49.322
不
No.

309
00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:52.659
抱歉
Excuse me. Sorry.

310
00:24:52.826 --> 00:24:54.119
凱西，不
Oh, Cassie, no.

311
00:24:54.285 --> 00:24:55.745
不…
No, no, no.

312
00:24:57.122 --> 00:24:58.832
不
No, no.

313
00:24:59.749 --> 00:25:02.669
拜託…不要有凱西
Please, please, please. No, Cassie.

314
00:25:04.921 --> 00:25:08.091
（史考特朗恩）

315
00:25:09.884 --> 00:25:11.052
什麼？
What?

316
00:25:41.124 --> 00:25:42.459
凱西？
Cassie?

317
00:25:43.626 --> 00:25:45.003
爸
Dad?

318
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:12.781
妳長這麼大了
You're so big!

319
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:17.660
（管制區，請勿進入）

320
00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:31.257
我們登上丹佛斯發現的可疑戰艦
Yeah. We boarded that highly-suspect warship Danvers pinged.

321
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:33.134
那是艘髒亂不堪的垃圾船
It was an infectious garbage scow.

322
00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:34.761
感謝提供珍貴情報
So, thanks for the hot tip.

323
00:26:34.928 --> 00:26:36.262
你們比較接近嘛
Well, you were closer.

324
00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:37.722
現在我們渾身垃圾味
Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

325
00:26:37.889 --> 00:26:39.224
有那些震動的讀數嗎？
You get a reading on those tremors?

326
00:26:39.391 --> 00:26:41.976
那是非洲板塊底下的輕微隱沒作用
'Twas a mild subduction under the African plate.

327
00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:44.187
有影像嗎？如何處理？
Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?

328
00:26:44.354 --> 00:26:45.522
小娜
Nat.

329
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.941
那是海底的地震
It's an earthquake under the ocean.

330
00:26:48.108 --> 00:26:50.944
不需要處理
We handle it by not handling it.

331
00:26:51.695 --> 00:26:53.822
卡蘿，下個月妳會來嗎？
Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

332
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.991
-應該不會 -妳又要去剪頭髮嗎？
Not likely. What? You gonna get another haircut?

333
00:26:57.158 --> 00:26:58.493
聽好，毛毛臉
Listen, fur face.

334
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.453
我負責的區域非常大
I'm covering a lot of territory.

335
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.748
其他地方都跟地球發生同樣的情形
The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere.

336
00:27:04.082 --> 00:27:05.917
幾千顆星球
On thousands of planets.

337
00:27:06.084 --> 00:27:08.753
好啦，有道理
All right, all right. That's a good point.

338
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.006
你們應該很久都見不到我
That's a good point. So, you might not see me for a long time.

339
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.508
好吧
All right. Uh, well...

340
00:27:14.384 --> 00:27:16.511
這個頻道隨時暢通
This channel's always active.

341
00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:18.763
只要出了問題
So, if anything goes sideways...

342
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.349
有人無故製造麻煩
anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't...

343
00:27:21.516 --> 00:27:22.684
請通知我
comes through me.

344
00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:24.310
好
Okay.

345
00:27:24.477 --> 00:27:25.937
好吧
All right.

346
00:27:26.688 --> 00:27:27.772
祝你好運
Good luck.

347
00:27:36.364 --> 00:27:37.365
你在哪？
Where are you?

348
00:27:37.532 --> 00:27:38.533
墨西哥
Mexico.

349
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.327
聯邦人員發現一個滿是屍體的房間
The Federales found a room full of bodies.

350
00:27:41.494 --> 00:27:43.121
看來是販毒集團
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys...

351
00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:45.248
連開槍的機會都沒有
never even had a chance to get their guns off.

352
00:27:45.415 --> 00:27:47.125
應該是敵對幫派幹的
It's probably a rival gang.

353
00:27:47.292 --> 00:27:48.501
並不是
Except it isn't.

354
00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:50.837
絕對是巴頓
It's definitely Barton.

355
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:53.006
他在這裡的所作所為
What he's done here...

356
00:27:53.173 --> 00:27:56.343
過去幾年來幹的好事
what he's been doing for the last few years...

357
00:27:57.177 --> 00:27:58.970
他造成的後果…
I mean, the scene that he left...

358
00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:03.516
其實我並不是那麼想找到他
I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him.

359
00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:11.358
你能發現他接下來的去處嗎？
Will you find out where he's going next?

360
00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:16.404
小娜？
Nat?

361
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:19.908
求求你
Please?

362
00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:22.827
好吧
Okay.

363
00:28:31.628 --> 00:28:33.463
我想幫妳煮晚餐
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner...

364
00:28:33.797 --> 00:28:35.382
不過妳已經夠慘了
but you seem pretty miserable already.

365
00:28:39.469 --> 00:28:40.887
你來洗衣服嗎？
You here to do your laundry?

366
00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:42.639
還有看朋友
And to see a friend.

367
00:28:43.723 --> 00:28:46.393
你朋友明明好得很
Clearly, your friend is fine.

368
00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:51.648
我過橋時看到一群鯨魚
You know, I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge.

369
00:28:51.815 --> 00:28:53.650
-哈德遜河？ -船變少了…
- In the Hudson? - There's fewer ships...

370
00:28:53.817 --> 00:28:55.068
水變乾淨了
cleaner water.

371
00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:59.155
如果你想叫我看開點
You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side...

372
00:29:01.533 --> 00:29:05.120
我就用花生醬三明治丟你的頭
Um... I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.

373
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.248
抱歉
Hmm. Sorry.

374
00:29:08.415 --> 00:29:09.582
老毛病
Force of habit.

375
00:29:23.847 --> 00:29:26.975
我不斷告訴別人應該放下過去
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on...

376
00:29:27.308 --> 00:29:28.810
成長
and grow.

377
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.312
有的人可以
Some do.

378
00:29:34.774 --> 00:29:36.276
我們辦不到
But not us.

379
00:29:37.027 --> 00:29:39.070
如果我放下過去，誰來扛？
If I move on, who does this?

380
00:29:39.446 --> 00:29:41.573
也許不需要有人扛
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

381
00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:48.038
從前我一無所有
I used to have nothing.

382
00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:51.124
後來有了這個
And then I got this.

383
00:29:53.293 --> 00:29:55.128
這個任務
This job.

384
00:29:57.505 --> 00:29:59.257
這個家庭
This family.

385
00:30:03.055 --> 00:30:06.931
我因此變得更好
And I was better because of it.

386
00:30:13.188 --> 00:30:16.733
即使他們走了
And even though they're gone...

387
00:30:20.695 --> 00:30:23.114
我還是想變得更好
I'm still trying to be better.

388
00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:28.578
我們都應該好好過日子
I think we both need to get a life.

389
00:30:30.997 --> 00:30:32.415
你先
You first.

390
00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:40.423
嗨，有人在嗎？
Oh, hi, hi! Uh, is anyone home?

391
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.300
我是史考特朗恩
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

392
00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:45.303
我們幾年前在德國的機場
We met a few years ago at the airport...

393
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.138
見過面
in Germany?

394
00:30:47.305 --> 00:30:49.599
我變成巨人，戴著頭盔
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on.

395
00:30:49.766 --> 00:30:51.267
-你們認不出我 -這是舊訊息嗎？
- You wouldn't recognize me. - Is this an old message?

396
00:30:51.434 --> 00:30:54.396
蟻人，我知道你們曉得
Ant-Man? I know you know that.

397
00:30:54.562 --> 00:30:57.148
-他在前門 -我真的需要跟你們談
It's the front gate. I really need to talk to you guys.

398
00:31:03.321 --> 00:31:04.489
史考特
Scott.

399
00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:06.449
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

400
00:31:06.616 --> 00:31:07.617
嗯
Yeah.

401
00:31:09.411 --> 00:31:11.788
你們念過量子物理學嗎？
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?

402
00:31:12.205 --> 00:31:13.707
只拿來聊天打屁
Only to make conversation.

403
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:16.418
好
All right, so...

404
00:31:16.793 --> 00:31:19.504
五年前，就在…
five years ago, right before...

405
00:31:20.088 --> 00:31:21.214
薩諾斯之前
Thanos...

406
00:31:21.589 --> 00:31:23.675
我到了量子領域裡
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

407
00:31:23.842 --> 00:31:26.344
量子領域自成一個微型宇宙
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.

408
00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:28.638
你必須變得極小才能進去
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.

409
00:31:28.805 --> 00:31:30.348
荷普，她是我的…
Hope. She's my, um...

410
00:31:32.434 --> 00:31:34.144
她是我的…
She was my...

411
00:31:35.854 --> 00:31:37.063
她應該讓我出去
She was supposed to pull me out.

412
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.815
後來發生了薩諾斯事件
And then Thanos happened...

413
00:31:38.982 --> 00:31:40.650
我因而困在裡面
and I got stuck in there.

414
00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:43.069
很遺憾，那五年想必很漫長
I'm sorry, that must have been a very long five years.

415
00:31:43.236 --> 00:31:44.571
重點就在這裡
Yeah, but that's just it.

416
00:31:44.738 --> 00:31:45.905
並不是
It wasn't.

417
00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:47.282
對我來說只是五小時
For me, it was five hours.

418
00:31:47.449 --> 00:31:49.868
量子領域毫無規則可言
See, the rules of the quantum realm aren't like they are up here.

419
00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:51.578
一切都無法預測
Everything is unpredictable.

420
00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:52.954
那是誰的三明治？
Is that anybody's sandwich?

421
00:31:53.121 --> 00:31:54.372
我餓扁了
I'm starving.

422
00:31:54.706 --> 00:31:55.832
史考特
Scott.

423
00:31:55.999 --> 00:31:57.292
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

424
00:31:58.293 --> 00:31:59.544
所以…
So...

425
00:32:00.503 --> 00:32:02.088
我想說的是…
what I'm saying is...

426
00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:05.383
量子領域裡的時間不一樣
time works differently in the quantum realm.

427
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.845
唯一的問題是我們在裡面找不到方向
The only problem is right now we don't have a way to navigate it.

428
00:32:09.012 --> 00:32:10.013
要是可以呢？
But what if we did?

429
00:32:10.764 --> 00:32:13.975
我忍不住想，要是我們能控制混亂局面
I can't stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos...

430
00:32:14.142 --> 00:32:15.268
在裡面找到方向呢？
and we could navigate it?

431
00:32:15.435 --> 00:32:16.936
要是有辦法…
What if there was a way...

432
00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:19.898
在某個時間點進入量子領域
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time...

433
00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:22.776
又在另一個時間點離開量子領域呢？
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time?

434
00:32:22.942 --> 00:32:24.277
譬如…
Like...

435
00:32:25.028 --> 00:32:27.113
-譬如薩諾斯事件之前 -等等
- Like before Thanos. - Wait.

436
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.865
你說的是時間機器嗎？
Are you talking about a time machine?

437
00:32:29.032 --> 00:32:31.785
當然不是，不是時間機器
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.

438
00:32:31.951 --> 00:32:32.994
這比較像…
This is more like a...

439
00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:36.956
對，像時間機器
Yeah. Like a time machine.

440
00:32:37.123 --> 00:32:38.917
我知道很誇張，很誇張
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

441
00:32:39.668 --> 00:32:42.462
但我忍不住一直想，應該…
But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be...

442
00:32:43.213 --> 00:32:44.506
有辦法
some way...

443
00:32:44.673 --> 00:32:46.466
-太誇張了 -史考特
- It's crazy. - Scott.

444
00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:47.926
我會收到浣熊寄來的電郵
I get emails from a raccoon...

445
00:32:48.093 --> 00:32:50.095
已經沒什麼叫太誇張了
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

446
00:32:50.845 --> 00:32:52.931
那我們必須找誰談？
So, who do we talk to about this?

447
00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:12.117
吃飯了
Chow time!

448
00:33:14.577 --> 00:33:15.620
小摩
Maguna.

449
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:21.418
摩根史塔克，想吃午餐嗎？
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

450
00:33:22.585 --> 00:33:24.796
解釋午餐，不然死翹翹 -好啦
Define "lunch" or be disintegrated. - Okay.

451
00:33:26.172 --> 00:33:27.632
妳不應該戴這個
You should not be wearing that, okay?

452
00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:30.343
這是我做給媽媽的週年紀念禮物
That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom.

453
00:33:34.097 --> 00:33:36.683
拿起來，想吃午餐嗎？
There you go. You thinking about lunch?

454
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.768
我弄蟋蟀配生菜給妳吃
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

455
00:33:38.935 --> 00:33:40.645
-不要 -那是妳想吃的啊
- No. - That's what you want.

456
00:33:40.812 --> 00:33:42.939
妳怎麼發現這個的？
How did you find this?

457
00:33:43.106 --> 00:33:44.941
-車庫 -真的嗎？
- Garage. - Really?

458
00:33:45.108 --> 00:33:47.110
-妳去找這個嗎？ -沒有
- Were you looking for it? - No.

459
00:33:47.986 --> 00:33:49.863
不過是我發現的
- I found it, though. - Hmm.

460
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.781
妳喜歡去車庫喔？
You like going in the garage, huh?

461
00:33:51.948 --> 00:33:53.199
把拔也是
So does Daddy.

462
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.786
沒關係，媽不戴我買給她的東西
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.

463
00:33:59.497 --> 00:34:00.749
那我就…
So, I'm gonna...

464
00:34:18.266 --> 00:34:20.810
不，我們知道聽起來很扯
No. We know what it sounds like.

465
00:34:20.977 --> 00:34:22.645
東尼，以你的經驗，真的有可能嗎？
Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?

466
00:34:22.812 --> 00:34:25.315
量子漲落破壞普朗克尺度
Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck scale...

467
00:34:25.482 --> 00:34:28.276
接著引發德意志命題，這我們同意吧？
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?

468
00:34:28.443 --> 00:34:29.527
謝謝
Thank you.

469
00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:31.821
講白話，這表示回不了家
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

470
00:34:32.155 --> 00:34:33.406
-我回來了 -不對
- I did. - No.

471
00:34:33.573 --> 00:34:34.991
你是意外活下來
You accidentally survived.

472
00:34:35.533 --> 00:34:37.702
十億分之一的僥倖
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

473
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:40.955
現在你想…那叫什麼？
And now you wanna pull a... What do you call it?

474
00:34:42.999 --> 00:34:44.334
時間攔劫？
A time heist?

475
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:47.837
對，時間攔劫，以前怎麼沒想到？
Yeah, a time heist. Of course. Why didn't we think of this before?

476
00:34:48.004 --> 00:34:50.465
因為很可笑，癡人說夢
Oh, because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream.

477
00:34:50.632 --> 00:34:54.219
無限寶石在過去，我們能回去搶過來
The stones are in the past. We could go back, we could get them.

478
00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:56.680
我們一彈指就能救回所有人
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.

479
00:34:56.846 --> 00:34:58.765
或者火上加油
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

480
00:34:58.932 --> 00:34:59.933
我認為不會
I don't believe we would.

481
00:35:00.517 --> 00:35:03.061
有時好懷念這種天真的樂觀態度
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

482
00:35:03.937 --> 00:35:05.647
寄予厚望並沒有幫助
However, high hopes won't help...

483
00:35:05.814 --> 00:35:11.319
如果缺少安全執行時間攔劫的具體方法
if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist.

484
00:35:11.486 --> 00:35:14.322
我想最可能的結果是我們集體死亡
I believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise.

485
00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:17.367
嚴格遵守時間旅行的規則就不會
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.

486
00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:20.120
也就是不跟過去的自己對話
All right? It means no talking to our past selves...

487
00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:21.830
不賭運動比賽
no betting on sporting events.

488
00:35:21.996 --> 00:35:23.748
我要請你住嘴，史考特
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

489
00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:27.919
你意思是說你拯救宇宙的計畫
Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe...

490
00:35:28.086 --> 00:35:29.754
是根據《回到未來》？
is based on Back to the Future?

491
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.632
-是嗎？ -不是
- Is it? - No.

492
00:35:32.799 --> 00:35:34.968
你害我擔心了一下，那根本狗屁不通
Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that would be horseshit.

493
00:35:35.135 --> 00:35:37.429
量子物理學不是那樣運作的
That's not how quantum physics works.

494
00:35:37.595 --> 00:35:38.763
東尼
Tony.

495
00:35:40.724 --> 00:35:42.183
我們必須堅定立場
We have to take a stand.

496
00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:44.728
我們有，卻落得如此下場
We did stand. And yet, here we are.

497
00:35:47.063 --> 00:35:48.356
我知道你得冒很大的風險
I know you got a lot on the line.

498
00:35:48.857 --> 00:35:51.401
你有老婆，女兒
You got a wife, a daughter.

499
00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:54.070
但我失去了一個非常重要的人
But I lost someone very important to me.

500
00:35:54.237 --> 00:35:55.822
很多人也一樣
A lotta people did.

501
00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:58.992
現在我們有機會把她救回來
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...

502
00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:01.828
把所有人救回來，你卻說你根本不…
to bring everyone back, and you're telling me that you won't even...

503
00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:03.788
沒錯，我根本不願意
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

504
00:36:05.498 --> 00:36:06.833
我不能
I can't.

505
00:36:09.002 --> 00:36:11.254
媽咪叫我來救你
Mommy told me to come and save you.

506
00:36:11.421 --> 00:36:13.840
很好，我得救了
Good job. I'm saved.

507
00:36:14.591 --> 00:36:17.761
真希望你們是來問別的事，什麼都好
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. Anything else.

508
00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:19.721
很高興見到你們
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just...

509
00:36:19.888 --> 00:36:21.514
-午餐準備了六人份 -東尼
Oh, look, the table's set for six.

510
00:36:21.681 --> 00:36:22.766
我懂
Tony. I get it.

511
00:36:22.932 --> 00:36:25.226
我替你高興，真的
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

512
00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:27.520
但這是第二次機會
But this is a second chance.

513
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:30.648
我的第二次機會在這裡，隊長
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

514
00:36:30.815 --> 00:36:32.359
不能冒險
Can't roll the dice on it.

515
00:36:34.444 --> 00:36:36.363
不聊工作的話請留下來吃飯
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.

516
00:36:39.616 --> 00:36:40.825
他怕了
Well, he's scared.

517
00:36:41.493 --> 00:36:42.535
他也沒錯
He's not wrong.

518
00:36:42.702 --> 00:36:44.704
那我們怎麼辦？
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we gonna do?

519
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:46.164
我們需要他，難道就此收手嗎？
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

520
00:36:47.082 --> 00:36:49.084
不，我想妥善規劃
No, I wanna do it right.

521
00:36:52.295 --> 00:36:53.963
我們需要一個非常聰明的人
We're gonna need a really big brain.

522
00:36:55.048 --> 00:36:56.466
比他還聰明？
Bigger than his?

523
00:36:56.925 --> 00:36:59.552
好像只有我在吃，嚐嚐看嘛
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating here.

524
00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:00.720
吃點蛋
Try some of that. Have some eggs.

525
00:37:01.221 --> 00:37:02.472
我搞糊塗了
I'm so confused.

526
00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:04.307
這年頭是很讓人困惑
These are confusing times.

527
00:37:04.474 --> 00:37:06.393
我不是那意思
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

528
00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:09.062
我瞭，開玩笑的
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

529
00:37:09.646 --> 00:37:11.439
我知道很扯
I know, it's crazy.

530
00:37:11.606 --> 00:37:12.816
我竟然穿衣服
I'm wearing shirts now.

531
00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:15.819
對啊，怎麼會？為什麼？
Yeah. What? How? Why?

532
00:37:16.277 --> 00:37:18.613
五年前，我們吃了敗仗
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

533
00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:20.865
只是我更慘
Except it was worse for me...

534
00:37:21.032 --> 00:37:22.242
我輸了兩次
'cause I lost twice.

535
00:37:22.409 --> 00:37:24.202
首先浩克輸了，班納又輸
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

536
00:37:25.078 --> 00:37:26.329
然後我們全都輸了
and then, we all lost.

537
00:37:26.496 --> 00:37:27.747
沒人怪你，布魯斯
No one blamed you, Bruce.

538
00:37:27.914 --> 00:37:29.290
我怪我自己
I did.

539
00:37:31.042 --> 00:37:33.420
多年來我把浩克當成一種病
For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind

540
00:37:33.586 --> 00:37:35.046
想去之而後快
of disease... something to get rid of.

541
00:37:35.797 --> 00:37:38.466
後來我開始將他視為解藥
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

542
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.177
在伽瑪實驗室研究了18個月
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

543
00:37:41.344 --> 00:37:43.930
將智慧與體力結合起來
I put the brains and the brawn together...

544
00:37:44.097 --> 00:37:45.348
現在看看我
and now, look at me.

545
00:37:46.391 --> 00:37:47.726
頭腦和四肢同樣發達
Best of both worlds.

546
00:37:48.476 --> 00:37:49.811
-對不起，浩克先生？ -是
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.

547
00:37:49.978 --> 00:37:51.312
我們能跟你合照嗎？
Can we get a photo?

548
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.732
沒問題，小朋友
100%, little person.

549
00:37:53.898 --> 00:37:55.942
過來…幫我們拍？
Come on, step on up. Do you mind?

550
00:37:56.651 --> 00:37:58.319
-好啊 -謝謝
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Thanks.

551
00:37:58.486 --> 00:38:00.071
說七
Say "green."

552
00:38:00.238 --> 00:38:02.490
-七 -七
- Green. - Green.

553
00:38:02.657 --> 00:38:03.575
拍到了嗎？
Did you get that?

554
00:38:03.742 --> 00:38:04.993
很好看
That's a good one.

555
00:38:05.785 --> 00:38:08.038
想跟我合照嗎？我是蟻人
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.

556
00:38:11.708 --> 00:38:13.626
他們是浩克粉絲，不認識蟻人
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man.

557
00:38:13.793 --> 00:38:14.878
沒人認識我
Nobody does.

558
00:38:15.045 --> 00:38:16.588
-他要你跟他合照 -我不想拍
- No, he wants you to take a picture with him. - I don't want a picture.

559
00:38:16.755 --> 00:38:17.756
小心怪叔叔
Stranger danger.

560
00:38:17.922 --> 00:38:19.466
他竟然拒絕
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't.

561
00:38:19.632 --> 00:38:21.676
-我懂了，我也不想拍 -別這樣
I get it. I don't want it, either.

562
00:38:21.843 --> 00:38:23.261
我不想跟他們合照
But come on. The kid... I don't want a picture with them.

563
00:38:23.428 --> 00:38:24.429
-他會很難過 -抱歉
- He's gonna feel bad. - Sorry.

564
00:38:24.596 --> 00:38:25.764
他們很樂意合照
They're happy to do it. They said they'll do it.

565
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.390
-我不想拍 -我們可以
- I don't want to do it. - We can do it.

566
00:38:27.557 --> 00:38:29.559
-你不爽了 -手機拿去
- No, you feel bad. - Take the goddamn phone.

567
00:38:29.726 --> 00:38:30.894
好
Okay.

568
00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:33.730
-謝謝你，浩克先生 -很棒，謝謝你們
Thank you, Mr. Hulk. No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.

569
00:38:34.189 --> 00:38:35.565
浩克萬歲
Hulk out!

570
00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:36.608
布魯斯
Bruce.

571
00:38:37.192 --> 00:38:38.193
帥
Dab.

572
00:38:38.526 --> 00:38:40.153
-布魯斯 -要聽媽媽的話
- Bruce. - Listen to your mom.

573
00:38:40.528 --> 00:38:41.529
她懂比較多
She knows better.

574
00:38:41.696 --> 00:38:43.365
關於我們說的事
About what we were saying.

575
00:38:43.531 --> 00:38:44.741
對
Right.

576
00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:49.371
靠時間旅行來逆轉？
The whole time travel do-over?

577
00:38:50.663 --> 00:38:54.417
那超出我的專業領域
Eh, guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

578
00:38:54.876 --> 00:38:56.127
你成功轉型了啊
Well, you pulled this off.

579
00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.965
以前這也是不可能的任務
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too.

580
00:39:34.249 --> 00:39:37.085
我有一點靈感，想看看是否正確
I've got a mild inspiration. I'd like to see if it checks out.

581
00:39:37.252 --> 00:39:41.006
睡前我想做最後一次模擬
So, I'd like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night.

582
00:39:41.172 --> 00:39:45.552
這次用反轉的莫比烏斯帶形狀
This time, in the shape of a Möbius strip, inverted, please.

583
00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:46.803
處理中
Processing.

584
00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:52.767
給我那個粒子的特徵值
Right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle...

585
00:39:52.934 --> 00:39:54.936
並考慮頻譜分解
factoring in spectral decomp.

586
00:39:55.103 --> 00:39:57.063
-這需要一段時間 -請稍候
- That'll take a second. - Just a moment.

587
00:39:58.106 --> 00:40:00.984
不順利的話也別擔心，我…
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda...

588
00:40:02.527 --> 00:40:04.029
模型成形
Model rendered.

589
00:40:06.406 --> 00:40:07.323
（模型成功）

590
00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:16.666
靠！
Shit!

591
00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:18.043
靠！
Shit!

592
00:40:22.464 --> 00:40:24.174
妳怎麼起來了，小姐？
What are you doing up, little miss?

593
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:26.051
-靠 -不能說這個字
- Shit. - Nope. We don't say that.

594
00:40:26.217 --> 00:40:27.427
只有媽咪才能說
Only Mommy says that word.

595
00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:29.012
她發明的，媽咪專用
She coined it. It belongs to her.

596
00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:30.138
你怎麼起來了？
Why are you up?

597
00:40:30.305 --> 00:40:31.681
因為我有重要的事要做
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here!

598
00:40:31.848 --> 00:40:33.016
妳覺得呢？
Why do you think?

599
00:40:33.183 --> 00:40:36.144
不，我在想事情…
No, I got something on my mind.

600
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:37.854
你在想果汁冰棒嗎？
I got something on my mind. Was it juice pops?

601
00:40:39.397 --> 00:40:40.607
當然
Sure was.

602
00:40:42.025 --> 00:40:43.777
妳勒索我
That's extortion. That's a word.

603
00:40:43.943 --> 00:40:45.111
妳要哪一種？
What kind you want?

604
00:40:45.278 --> 00:40:46.279
英雄所見略同
Great minds think alike.

605
00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:48.281
果汁冰棒就是…
Juice pops exactly...

606
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.576
我腦袋在想的
was on my mind.

607
00:40:52.994 --> 00:40:54.120
吃完了嗎？
You done? Yeah?

608
00:40:54.662 --> 00:40:55.872
吃完了
Now you are.

609
00:40:56.456 --> 00:40:57.624
擦擦
Here. Wipe.

610
00:41:00.335 --> 00:41:03.004
好，躺下去
Good. That face goes there.

611
00:41:03.171 --> 00:41:04.422
說故事給我聽
Tell me a story.

612
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:06.174
故事
A story.

613
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:08.468
很久以前，小摩上床睡覺，完
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.

614
00:41:08.843 --> 00:41:10.220
好爛的故事
That is a horrible story.

615
00:41:10.387 --> 00:41:12.138
這是妳最喜歡的故事
Come on, that's your favourite story.

616
00:41:12.847 --> 00:41:14.015
愛妳喔
Love you tons.

617
00:41:16.017 --> 00:41:17.852
我愛你三千次
I love you 3,000.

618
00:41:19.104 --> 00:41:20.105
哇
Wow.

619
00:41:27.445 --> 00:41:30.323
三千次，超多的
3,000. That's crazy.

620
00:41:31.533 --> 00:41:33.326
睡覺，不然賣掉妳的玩具
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

621
00:41:34.536 --> 00:41:35.870
晚安
Night night.

622
00:41:36.037 --> 00:41:37.247
這不是比賽
Not that it's a competition...

623
00:41:37.747 --> 00:41:39.666
不過她愛我三千次
but she loves me 3,000.

624
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:40.917
是喔？
Does she, now?

625
00:41:41.084 --> 00:41:44.129
妳只有六百到九百次
You were somewhere in the low 6 to 900 range.

626
00:41:50.176 --> 00:41:51.678
在看什麼？
Whatcha reading?

627
00:41:52.303 --> 00:41:53.763
製作堆肥的書
Just a book on composting.

628
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.016
堆肥有什麼新發展？
What's new with composting?

629
00:41:57.475 --> 00:41:59.519
-有趣的科學… -我想通了
- Interesting science... - I figured it out.

630
00:42:00.603 --> 00:42:01.604
順便說一聲
By the way.

631
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.859
我們講的是同一件事…
And, you know, just so we're talking about the same thing...

632
00:42:06.026 --> 00:42:07.485
時間旅行
Time travel.

633
00:42:08.153 --> 00:42:08.987
什麼？
What?

634
00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:14.200
哇
Wow.

635
00:42:16.288 --> 00:42:19.000
好驚人
That's amazing...

636
00:42:19.000  --> 00:42:21.916
也好可怕
and terrifying.

637
00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:23.543
沒錯
That's right.

638
00:42:30.842 --> 00:42:32.552
我們真的很幸運
We got really lucky.

639
00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:33.720
嗯
Yeah.

640
00:42:33.887 --> 00:42:35.013
我知道
I know.

641
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.306
很多人沒這麼好運
A lot of people didn't.

642
00:42:36.473 --> 00:42:38.099
對，我救不了所有人
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

643
00:42:39.851 --> 00:42:41.186
感覺好像你可以
Sorta seems like you can.

644
00:42:41.353 --> 00:42:42.979
我停止的話就不能
Not if I stop.

645
00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:47.025
我能馬上煞車，停止
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

646
00:42:47.817 --> 00:42:48.818
東尼
Tony...

647
00:42:49.527 --> 00:42:51.071
設法阻止你
trying to get you to stop...

648
00:42:51.237 --> 00:42:53.865
是我這輩子最大的敗筆之一
has been one of the few failures of my entire life.

649
00:42:58.161 --> 00:42:59.829
我有種感覺
Something tells me...

650
00:43:01.122 --> 00:43:03.792
我應該把它鎖進箱子，丟到湖底
I should put it in a lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

651
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:06.211
上床睡覺
and go to bed.

652
00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:14.636
但你睡得著嗎？
But would you be able to rest?

653
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:22.686
開始，時間旅行第一次測試
Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one.

654
00:43:22.852 --> 00:43:25.021
史考特，發動…
Scott, fire up...

655
00:43:25.939 --> 00:43:27.107
廂型車
the, uh, van thing.

656
00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:30.443
斷路器準備
Breakers are set.

657
00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.445
緊急發電機就緒
Emergency generators are on standby.

658
00:43:32.612 --> 00:43:37.534
要是斷電，我可不想在50年代失去奈米哥
Good, because if we blow the grid, I don't want to lose, uh, Tiny here in the 1950s.

659
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:38.535
你說什麼？
- Excuse me?

660
00:43:38.702 --> 00:43:40.662
他開玩笑的
- He's kidding.

661
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:42.789
你不能說這種話
You can't say things like that.

662
00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:44.457
冷笑話
It was a bad joke.

663
00:43:46.459 --> 00:43:47.419
你開玩笑的吧？
You were kidding, right?

664
00:43:47.585 --> 00:43:50.714
我不知道，這可是時間旅行
I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here.

665
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.133
可能全是笑話，也可能都不是
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

666
00:43:53.299 --> 00:43:54.968
搞定了
We're good!

667
00:43:55.135 --> 00:43:56.469
戴上頭盔
Get your helmet on.

668
00:43:57.095 --> 00:43:58.888
史考特，我送你回到一週前
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week...

669
00:43:59.055 --> 00:44:02.267
讓你待一小時，十秒後帶你回來
let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds.

670
00:44:02.434 --> 00:44:03.435
有道理嗎？
Make sense?

671
00:44:04.102 --> 00:44:05.353
十分清楚
Perfectly not confusing.

672
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.480
祝你好運，史考特，你沒問題的
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

673
00:44:09.024 --> 00:44:12.068
對，我沒問題，美國隊長…
You're right. I do, Captain America.

674
00:44:14.237 --> 00:44:15.572
倒數三秒
On a count of three...

675
00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:19.617
三，二，一
Three, two, one.

676
00:44:23.705 --> 00:44:24.539
大夥
Uh... Guys?

677
00:44:25.081 --> 00:44:26.875
感覺不對勁
This doesn't feel right.

678
00:44:27.042 --> 00:44:27.876
怎麼了？
What is this?

679
00:44:28.043 --> 00:44:28.877
-怎麼搞的？ -他是誰？
- What's going on? - Who is that?

680
00:44:29.044 --> 00:44:29.878
-等等 -那是史考特嗎？
- Hold on. - Is that Scott?

681
00:44:30.045 --> 00:44:30.920
我是史考特
Yes, it's Scott.

682
00:44:33.798 --> 00:44:36.343
-怎麼了，布魯斯？ -我的背！
- What's going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!

683
00:44:36.509 --> 00:44:37.469
-怎麼搞的？ -等一下
- What is this? - Hold on a second.

684
00:44:37.635 --> 00:44:38.887
-給我一點空間 -好
Could I get a little space here? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
00:44:39.054 --> 00:44:40.930
-你能帶他回來嗎？ -正在想辦法
Can you bring him back? I'm working on it.

686
00:44:47.979 --> 00:44:48.980
一個嬰兒
It's a baby.

687
00:44:49.147 --> 00:44:50.690
-是史考特 -變成嬰兒
- It's Scott. - As a baby.

688
00:44:50.857 --> 00:44:52.233
-他會長大 -帶史考特回來
- He'll grow. - Bring Scott back.

689
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.777
我說關掉就關掉
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

690
00:44:53.943 --> 00:44:55.195
天啊
Oh, my God.

691
00:44:55.904 --> 00:44:57.280
關掉
And... kill it!

692
00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:03.495
有人尿在我褲子上
Somebody peed my pants.

693
00:45:03.661 --> 00:45:04.621
謝天謝地
Oh, thank God.

694
00:45:04.788 --> 00:45:07.999
不知是嬰兒期的我還是老年的我
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

695
00:45:11.336 --> 00:45:13.296
或者現在的我
Or just me me.

696
00:45:13.713 --> 00:45:14.923
時間旅行
Time travel!

697
00:45:18.677 --> 00:45:19.678
怎樣？
What?

698
00:45:21.346 --> 00:45:23.598
我覺得非常成功
I see this as an absolute win.

699
00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:10.562
幹嘛苦瓜臉？
Why the long face?

700
00:46:10.729 --> 00:46:12.480
我猜，他變成嬰兒
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

701
00:46:13.732 --> 00:46:15.734
是有那麼一回事，你來幹嘛？
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?

702
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.318
這是EPR弔詭
It's the EPR Paradox.

703
00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:20.155
與其讓朗恩穿越時間，不如…
Instead of pushing Lang through time,

704
00:46:20.321 --> 00:46:21.740
讓時間穿越朗恩
you might've wound up... pushing time through Lang.

705
00:46:21.906 --> 00:46:24.576
那樣困難又危險，該有人警告你們的
It's tricky, dangerous. Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

706
00:46:24.743 --> 00:46:25.702
你警告過了
You did.

707
00:46:25.869 --> 00:46:27.078
是嗎？
Oh, did I?

708
00:46:27.245 --> 00:46:28.913
幸好我來了
Well, thank God I'm here.

709
00:46:29.706 --> 00:46:31.332
反正，我修好了
Regardless, I fixed it.

710
00:46:32.417 --> 00:46:34.711
運作正常的時空GPS
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

711
00:46:36.796 --> 00:46:38.048
我只要和解
I just want peace.

712
00:46:39.674 --> 00:46:42.385
怨恨有害身心，我不喜歡
Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

713
00:46:43.261 --> 00:46:44.637
我也是
Me, too.

714
00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:49.351
有機會拿到寶石，但先說我的優先順序
We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities.

715
00:46:49.517 --> 00:46:51.853
我希望救回失去的
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

716
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.856
不計代價留下我發現的
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs.

717
00:46:56.107 --> 00:46:58.693
但願不必至死方休
And maybe not die trying.

718
00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.903
那樣就好
Would be nice.

719
00:47:02.364 --> 00:47:03.448
聽起來可行
Sounds like a deal.

720
00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:28.056
東尼，我不知道
Tony, I don't know.

721
00:47:28.223 --> 00:47:29.849
為什麼？
Why?

722
00:47:30.016 --> 00:47:31.810
他為你做的
He made it for you.

723
00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:35.563
我特地從垃圾堆挖出來，免得摩根當雪橇
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

724
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:42.237
謝謝你，東尼
Thank you, Tony.

725
00:47:43.238 --> 00:47:44.781
可以別聲張嗎？
Will you keep that a little quiet?

726
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.866
不是每個人都有
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

727
00:47:48.618 --> 00:47:51.913
我們會集結整個團隊吧？
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

728
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.832
正在努力
We're working on that right now.

729
00:48:11.933 --> 00:48:12.976
人類哥
Hey, Humie.

730
00:48:13.518 --> 00:48:15.311
綠巨人呢？
Where's Big Green?

731
00:48:15.645 --> 00:48:17.689
在廚房吧
The kitchen, I think.

732
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.150
帥呆了
That's awesome.

733
00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.445
羅德，重新進入時小心
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

734
00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:25.321
降落區有個白癡
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

735
00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:27.615
天啊
Oh, God.

736
00:48:28.199 --> 00:48:30.243
你好，正常尺寸蟻人
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

737
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:03.985
（歡迎蒞臨新阿斯嘉，請慢速行駛）

738
00:49:21.086 --> 00:49:25.423
這比黃金宮殿和魔力神鎚掉漆多了
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces and the magic hammers and what not.

739
00:49:25.507 --> 00:49:26.883
有點同情心
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

740
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:29.010
他們先失去阿斯嘉，又少了一半人口
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people.

741
00:49:29.177 --> 00:49:30.720
有個家就偷笑了
They're probably just happy to have a home.

742
00:49:30.887 --> 00:49:32.597
你們不該來的
You shouldn't have come.

743
00:49:32.683 --> 00:49:35.684
瓦爾基麗
Ah! Valkyrie!

744
00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:38.561
真高興見到妳，憤怒姊
Great to see you, angry girl!

745
00:49:38.728 --> 00:49:40.939
我比較喜歡你原來那兩個版本
I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

746
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.983
-這是火箭 -妳好嗎？
This is Rocket. How ya doing?

747
00:49:46.403 --> 00:49:47.404
他不會見你們的
He won't see you.

748
00:49:47.737 --> 00:49:48.780
那麼慘？
It's that bad, huh?

749
00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:51.658
我們一個月只見他一次…他來補貨時
We only see him once a month

750
00:49:51.825 --> 00:49:53.576
（阿斯嘉麥芽啤酒，黑啤酒）
when he comes in for "supplies."

751
00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:55.787
慘到爆
It's that bad.

752
00:49:55.954 --> 00:49:56.955
是啊
Yeah.

753
00:50:09.467 --> 00:50:10.510
怎麼…
What the...?

754
00:50:13.972 --> 00:50:15.640
有東西死在裡面
Whew! Something died in here!

755
00:50:16.725 --> 00:50:18.977
哈囉？索爾
Hello? Thor!

756
00:50:19.519 --> 00:50:21.187
你是來修第四台嗎？
Are you here about the cable?

757
00:50:21.938 --> 00:50:24.024
電影台兩週前就不能看
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...

758
00:50:24.607 --> 00:50:27.360
體育台有雜訊
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

759
00:50:28.111 --> 00:50:29.112
索爾？
Thor?

760
00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:39.622
兄弟們，歐買尬！
Boys! Oh, my God!

761
00:50:40.248 --> 00:50:43.001
見到你們真好
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

762
00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:45.754
過來抱抱，小痞子
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

763
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.505
我很好…
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

764
00:50:48.548 --> 00:50:49.632
沒必要這樣
That's not necessary.

765
00:50:50.091 --> 00:50:52.761
浩克，認識我朋友米克和寇格吧？
Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?

766
00:50:52.927 --> 00:50:54.054
-你們好 -嗨
- Hey, boys! - Hey, guys.

767
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.472
好久不見
Long time no see.

768
00:50:55.638 --> 00:50:57.891
桶子裡有啤酒，無線網路儘管用
Beer's in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

769
00:50:58.058 --> 00:50:59.768
不用密碼
No password, obviously.

770
00:51:00.852 --> 00:51:02.354
索爾，他回來了
Thor, he's back.

771
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.190
電視上那小子又叫我豬頭
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.

772
00:51:05.732 --> 00:51:06.775
菜鳥大師
Noobmaster.

773
00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:09.402
菜鳥大師69叫我豬頭
Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.

774
00:51:09.569 --> 00:51:10.737
你好遜
I am sick of this.

775
00:51:11.654 --> 00:51:14.574
菜鳥大師，又是我，雷神索爾
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder.

776
00:51:14.741 --> 00:51:16.910
聽好，你要是不馬上登出這遊戲
Listen, bud, if you don't log off this game immediately...

777
00:51:17.077 --> 00:51:20.205
我就飛去你家，闖進你躲的地下室
I am gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in...

778
00:51:20.372 --> 00:51:22.999
扯斷你手臂，再塞進你屁眼
rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!

779
00:51:23.375 --> 00:51:26.419
沒錯，哭給你老北聽，賤胚
Oh, that's right, yes! Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

780
00:51:27.128 --> 00:51:28.129
謝謝你，索爾
Thank you, Thor.

781
00:51:28.296 --> 00:51:29.631
他再煩你就告訴我
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

782
00:51:29.798 --> 00:51:31.007
感恩，我會的
Thank you very much. I will.

783
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.301
你們想喝什麼嗎？
So, you guys want a drink? What are we drinking?

784
00:51:33.468 --> 00:51:35.887
我有啤酒、龍舌蘭，應有盡有
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.

785
00:51:38.765 --> 00:51:40.183
兄弟
Buddy.

786
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.309
你還好嗎？
- You all right?

787
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:42.811
我很好，怎樣？
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

788
00:51:42.977 --> 00:51:44.020
我看起來不好嗎？
Why, don't I look all right?

789
00:51:44.437 --> 00:51:45.855
你活像彌勒佛
You look like melted ice cream.

790
00:51:47.857 --> 00:51:49.943
怎樣？過來聊天打屁嗎？
So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what?

791
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.403
我們需要你幫忙
- We need your help. - Mm.

792
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.614
我們有機會逆轉局勢
There might be a chance we could fix everything.

793
00:51:54.781 --> 00:51:56.116
修第四台嗎？
What, like the cable?

794
00:51:56.282 --> 00:51:58.493
它害我抓狂好幾星期了
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

795
00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:59.661
薩諾斯
Like Thanos.

796
00:52:18.847 --> 00:52:21.683
別提起這名字
Don't say that name.

797
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:25.520
這裡不准說到那個髒東西
Um, yeah, we don't actually say that name in here.

798
00:52:30.358 --> 00:52:32.235
請把手拿開
Please take your hand off me.

799
00:52:35.655 --> 00:52:38.700
我知道那個傢伙…
Now, I know that guy...

800
00:52:39.617 --> 00:52:40.744
可能嚇到你
might scare you.

801
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:42.287
怎麼會？
Why would I be...?

802
00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:45.623
我怎麼會被那傢伙嚇到？
Why would I be scared of that guy?

803
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:47.625
那傢伙是我殺的，記得嗎？
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

804
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.837
這裡有別人殺了他嗎？
Hmm. Anyone else here kill that guy?

805
00:52:54.257 --> 00:52:55.342
沒有
Nope.

806
00:52:55.884 --> 00:52:56.885
應該沒有
Didn't think so.

807
00:52:57.969 --> 00:53:02.223
寇格，告訴大家誰砍掉薩諾斯的頭？
Korg, why don't you, uh, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off?

808
00:53:02.766 --> 00:53:03.808
風暴破壞者？
Um, Stormbreaker?

809
00:53:03.975 --> 00:53:05.602
誰揮舞風暴破壞者？
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

810
00:53:09.689 --> 00:53:11.900
我瞭解，你很不好受
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

811
00:53:12.067 --> 00:53:13.068
我感同身受
I've been there myself.

812
00:53:13.234 --> 00:53:15.528
想知道誰幫我走出來嗎？
And you want to know who helped me out of it?

813
00:53:15.695 --> 00:53:18.031
是娜塔莎嗎？
Was it Natasha?

814
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.367
是你
It was you.

815
00:53:20.533 --> 00:53:22.494
你幫助我
You helped me.

816
00:53:23.703 --> 00:53:25.163
你怎麼不問問…
So, why don't you ask...

817
00:53:26.247 --> 00:53:28.583
下面那些阿斯嘉人
the Asgardians down there...

818
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.460
我的幫助值多少？
how much my help is worth?

819
00:53:36.132 --> 00:53:37.592
剩下的那些人
The ones that are left, anyway.

820
00:53:38.134 --> 00:53:39.719
我想我們能救他們回來
I think we could bring them back.

821
00:53:40.637 --> 00:53:41.638
別講了
Stop.

822
00:53:42.764 --> 00:53:43.848
別講了好嗎？
Stop, okay?

823
00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:47.519
你以為我在這裡自艾自憐
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity...

824
00:53:47.686 --> 00:53:50.230
等著被人拯救
waiting to be rescued and saved...

825
00:53:50.397 --> 00:53:52.482
我很好，我們很好，對不對？
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we?

826
00:53:52.649 --> 00:53:54.109
我們在這裡好得很
Oh, we're good here, mate.

827
00:53:54.275 --> 00:53:56.236
不管你有什麼提議，我們沒興趣
So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it.

828
00:53:56.403 --> 00:53:57.904
完全不在乎
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

829
00:53:58.071 --> 00:53:59.155
再見
Goodbye.

830
00:54:02.534 --> 00:54:04.244
我們需要你
We need you, pal.

831
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:15.672
船上有啤酒
There's beer on the ship.

832
00:54:19.718 --> 00:54:21.344
哪一種？
What kind?

833
00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:27.892
（東京）

834
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.443
是他！他在追殺昭彥

835
00:55:03.178 --> 00:55:05.347
你為什麼這麼做？

836
00:55:06.973 --> 00:55:08.641
我們從來沒招惹過你

837
00:55:09.059 --> 00:55:10.268
你們活了下來

838
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.395
地球一半生物卻沒有

839
00:55:12.896 --> 00:55:14.314
他們碰上薩諾斯

840
00:55:14.898 --> 00:55:15.899
你們碰上我

841
00:55:21.154 --> 00:55:23.198
你們不能再傷人了

842
00:55:24.282 --> 00:55:26.368
我們傷人？

843
00:55:29.954 --> 00:55:30.830
你瘋了

844
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:02.112
等等，救我！

845
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.073
我什麼都能給你

846
00:56:06.324 --> 00:56:07.450
你要什麼？

847
00:56:07.617 --> 00:56:10.704
我要的，你沒辦法給
What I want you can't give me.

848
00:56:34.602 --> 00:56:35.770
妳不該來這裡
You shouldn't be here.

849
00:56:38.481 --> 00:56:40.233
你也不應該
Neither should you.

850
00:56:46.239 --> 00:56:47.699
我有任務在身
I've got a job to do.

851
00:56:49.284 --> 00:56:50.910
這就是你的任務嗎？
Is that what you're calling this?

852
00:56:51.995 --> 00:56:54.414
殺死這些人也不能讓你家人回來
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

853
00:57:00.253 --> 00:57:01.338
我們有所發現
We found something.

854
00:57:03.006 --> 00:57:05.175
說不定是個機會
A chance, maybe.

855
00:57:08.511 --> 00:57:09.721
不要
Don't.

856
00:57:10.638 --> 00:57:12.098
不要什麼？
Don't what?

857
00:57:15.143 --> 00:57:16.603
不要給我希望
Don't give me hope.

858
00:57:19.939 --> 00:57:22.400
抱歉我不能早點給你
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

859
00:57:43.963 --> 00:57:45.256
你往左偏了
You're drifting left.

860
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.550
直走，酒鬼
One side there, Lebowski.

861
00:57:50.762 --> 00:57:52.055
火焰，你好嗎？
Ratchet, how's it going?

862
00:57:52.222 --> 00:57:53.223
是火箭
It's Rocket.

863
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:55.934
放輕鬆，你只在地球上是天才
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

864
00:58:00.855 --> 00:58:02.440
時間旅行裝，不錯嘛
Time travel suit, not bad.

865
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.318
喂…輕一點…
Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!

866
00:58:05.485 --> 00:58:06.486
我非常小心
I'm being very careful.

867
00:58:06.653 --> 00:58:08.071
才怪，你非常浩克
No, you're being very Hulky.

868
00:58:08.238 --> 00:58:09.155
我非常小心
I'm being careful.

869
00:58:09.322 --> 00:58:10.699
這些是皮姆粒子
These are Pym Particles, all right?

870
00:58:10.865 --> 00:58:13.368
自從漢克皮姆消失後，只剩這個
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it.

871
00:58:13.535 --> 00:58:15.286
我們只有這個，再也做不出來了
This is what we have. We're not making any more.

872
00:58:15.453 --> 00:58:17.372
-史考特，冷靜點 -抱歉
- Scott, calm down. - Sorry.

873
00:58:17.706 --> 00:58:20.667
我們只夠一趟來回
We've got enough for one round-trip each. That's it.

874
00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:21.876
不能重來
No do-overs.

875
00:58:22.919 --> 00:58:24.254
再加兩次測試
Plus two test runs.

876
00:58:28.425 --> 00:58:29.259
一次測試
One test run.

877
00:58:30.593 --> 00:58:32.178
好，我還沒準備好
All right. I'm not ready for this.

878
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:33.638
我可以試試
I'm game.

879
00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:37.600
讓我來
I'll do it.

880
00:58:38.226 --> 00:58:41.229
克林特，你會因時間轉移而感到混亂
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift.

881
00:58:41.396 --> 00:58:43.273
-別擔心 -等等，我先問一件事
Don't worry about that. Wait a second. Let me ask you something.

882
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.066
如果我們能回到過去
If we can do this, you know...

883
00:58:45.233 --> 00:58:47.569
何不乾脆去找薩諾斯寶寶？
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos?

884
00:58:47.736 --> 00:58:48.903
就是…
You know, and...

885
00:58:52.907 --> 00:58:54.784
-首先，那樣很恐怖 -他是薩諾斯啊
First of all, that's horrible. It's Thanos.

886
00:58:54.951 --> 00:58:57.245
第二，時間不是那樣運作的
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.

887
00:58:57.412 --> 00:58:59.581
改變時間不會改變未來
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

888
00:58:59.748 --> 00:59:02.459
我們回去，比薩諾斯先拿到寶石
Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them...

889
00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:05.378
薩諾斯沒有寶石，問題解決
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

890
00:59:05.545 --> 00:59:07.380
-沒錯 -不是那樣子
- Bingo. - That's not how it works.

891
00:59:07.547 --> 00:59:09.674
-我聽到的是 -誰，誰告訴你的？
Well, that's what I heard. Wait, but who? Who told you that?

892
00:59:09.841 --> 00:59:11.634
"星際爭霸戰"、"魔鬼終結者"、"時空特警"
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

893
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:13.386
-"兩世奇人" -"時空怪客"
- Time After Time. - Quantum Leap.

894
00:59:13.553 --> 00:59:15.597
-"時間的皺摺"、"似曾相識" -"扭轉時光機"
Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.

895
00:59:15.764 --> 00:59:18.141
"扭轉時光機"﹑"阿比阿弟的冒險"
Hot Tub Time Machine. Hot Tub Time Machine.

896
00:59:18.308 --> 00:59:20.393
就是任何講時間旅行的電影
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

897
00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.395
"終極警探"…那部不是
Die Hard. No, that's not one.

898
00:59:22.562 --> 00:59:23.605
這是常識
This is known.

899
00:59:23.772 --> 00:59:26.024
我不知道為何大家都信，那不正確
I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true.

900
00:59:26.191 --> 00:59:28.193
想想看，如果旅行到過去
Think about it. If you travel to the past...

901
00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.695
那個過去就成了你的未來
that past becomes your future...

902
00:59:30.862 --> 00:59:33.823
你以前的現在就成為過去
and your former present becomes the past...

903
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:36.618
無法被新的未來改變
which can't now be changed by your new future.

904
00:59:36.785 --> 00:59:37.994
沒錯
Exactly.

905
00:59:38.578 --> 00:59:41.456
所以"回到未來"都在鬼扯？
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

906
00:59:45.377 --> 00:59:46.795
好，克林特
All right, Clint.

907
00:59:47.462 --> 00:59:50.507
倒數三，二…
We're going in three, two...

908
00:59:50.674 --> 00:59:51.675
一
one.

909
00:59:59.057 --> 01:00:01.434
（量子目標）

910
01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:05.373
庫柏
Cooper?

911
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.083
我的耳機呢？
Where are my headphones?

912
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.168
萊拉？
Lila?

913
01:01:08.335 --> 01:01:10.420
-我沒拿 -萊拉？
- I never had them. - Lila?

914
01:01:11.254 --> 01:01:13.173
你昨天拿去了
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

915
01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:15.050
萊拉…
Lila! Lila!

916
01:01:20.555 --> 01:01:21.556
爸？
Yeah, Dad?

917
01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:26.478
爸？
Dad?

918
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.273
萊拉
Lila!

919
01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:38.531
嘿…看著我
Hey. Hey, look at me.

920
01:01:38.698 --> 01:01:39.824
你還好嗎？
You okay?

921
01:01:40.533 --> 01:01:42.577
還好
Yeah. Yeah.

922
01:01:44.496 --> 01:01:45.663
成功了
It worked.

923
01:01:47.415 --> 01:01:48.792
成功了
It worked.

924
01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:50.085
（時間攔劫，腦力激盪時間）

925
01:01:50.585 --> 01:01:51.753
（宇宙魔方，空間寶石）

926
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.755
所以方法可行
Okay, so the how works.

927
01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:57.467
現在要找出時間和地點
Now, we gotta figure out the when and the where.

928
01:01:58.301 --> 01:02:00.095
在場幾乎每個人都曾經…
Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter...

929
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:01.930
與至少一顆無限寶石交手過
with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

930
01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:03.598
也可以把交手二字
Or substitute the word "encounter"...

931
01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:06.351
改成差點被無限寶石殺死
for "damn near been killed" by one of the six Infinity Stones.

932
01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:07.686
我沒有
Well, I haven't...

933
01:02:07.852 --> 01:02:10.188
我根本不知道你們在說什麼
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.

934
01:02:10.355 --> 01:02:15.110
無論如何，皮姆粒子只夠一趟來回使用
Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round-trip each.

935
01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:18.488
這些寶石在歷史上許多地方出現過
And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

936
01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:19.948
我們的歷史
Our history.

937
01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:23.118
容易前往的時間點並不多
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

938
01:02:23.284 --> 01:02:25.078
所以我們必須挑選目標
Which means we have to pick our targets.

939
01:02:25.537 --> 01:02:26.788
正確
Correct.

940
01:02:28.164 --> 01:02:29.749
那就從以太寶石開始
So, let's start with the Aether.

941
01:02:29.916 --> 01:02:31.126
索爾，你知道什麼？
Thor, what do you know?

942
01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:37.924
他在睡覺嗎？
Is he asleep?

943
01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:40.635
不，我確定他死了
No, no. I'm pretty sure he's dead.

944
01:02:41.177 --> 01:02:43.638
（目標：現實寶石）

945
01:02:44.055 --> 01:02:45.265
從哪裡開始講？
Uh, where to start? Um...

946
01:02:47.058 --> 01:02:49.602
首先，以太寶石不是寶石
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

947
01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:51.896
以前有人叫它寶石
Someone called it a stone before.

948
01:02:53.648 --> 01:02:57.277
它應該是一坨憤怒的爛泥
Um, it's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing...

949
01:02:57.444 --> 01:03:00.321
有人必須更正，別再那樣說
so someone's gonna need to amend that and stop saying that.

950
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.324
不過以太有個有趣的故事…
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether.

951
01:03:03.491 --> 01:03:05.368
多年前，我祖父…
My grandfather, many years ago...

952
01:03:05.535 --> 01:03:09.039
不得不藏起寶石，避開黑暗精靈
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.

953
01:03:10.957 --> 01:03:11.916
他們很恐怖
Ooh. Scary beings.

954
01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:13.793
珍其實…
So, Jane, actually...

955
01:03:14.377 --> 01:03:15.920
她在這裡
Oh, there she is.

956
01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:19.758
珍是我的舊情人
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

957
01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:23.970
有一次她的手卡在石頭裡
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...

958
01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:26.973
後來以太寶石卡在她體內
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...

959
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.184
她就病得非常嚴重
and she became very, very sick.

960
01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:32.479
我不得不帶她去阿斯嘉，我老家
And so I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from...

961
01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:34.606
想辦法治療她
and we had to try and fix her.

962
01:03:34.773 --> 01:03:36.399
當時我們在交往
We were dating at the time, you see...

963
01:03:36.566 --> 01:03:39.944
我介紹她給我母親
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

964
01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:43.323
我媽死了…
who's dead and, um...

965
01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:48.286
珍和我已經分手了
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so...

966
01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:50.538
男女分分合合
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

967
01:03:50.705 --> 01:03:52.040
沒什麼永恆，唯一…
Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that...

968
01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:53.958
-過來坐下吧 -我還沒講完
- Why don't you come sit down? - I'm not done yet.

969
01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:57.170
人生唯一恆久的東西就是無常
The only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence.

970
01:03:57.921 --> 01:04:00.215
棒呆了，想吃蛋嗎？早餐？
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

971
01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:02.425
不，我要一杯血腥瑪莉
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

972
01:04:02.592 --> 01:04:04.719
奎爾說他從莫拉格偷走力量寶石
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.

973
01:04:04.886 --> 01:04:05.970
（目標：力量寶石）

974
01:04:06.137 --> 01:04:08.515
-那是一個人嗎？ -不，莫拉格是星球
- Is that a person? - No, Morag's a planet.

975
01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:10.600
奎爾才是人
Quill was a person.

976
01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:13.687
星球？在外太空？
Like a planet? Like in outer space?

977
01:04:13.853 --> 01:04:18.066
看，好像一隻開心的小狗狗
Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.

978
01:04:18.233 --> 01:04:21.403
想上太空嗎？想上太空嗎，小狗狗？
Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy?

979
01:04:21.569 --> 01:04:22.696
我帶你上太空
I'll take you to space.

980
01:04:22.862 --> 01:04:23.905
（目標：靈魂寶石）

981
01:04:24.072 --> 01:04:25.990
薩諾斯在佛米爾發現靈魂寶石
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

982
01:04:26.157 --> 01:04:28.118
佛米爾是什麼？

耳鼻喉科醫生兼魔術師
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

-不，多倫多 -布利克和蘇利文街口
No, he lived in Toronto. Uh, yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.

如果挑對年份，紐約會有三顆寶石

998
01:05:11.244 --> 01:05:13.663
（紐約，阿斯嘉，莫拉格／佛米爾）

999
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.957
好，計畫成形

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:20.712
六顆寶石，三個團隊，一次機會

五年前我們輸了

1002
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:34.934
一敗塗地
All of us.

1003
01:05:36.853 --> 01:05:38.229

1005
01:05:42.567 --> 01:05:44.402
失去部分的自我

1006
01:05:45.862 --> 01:05:48.198
如今我們有機會扭轉乾坤

1007
01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:52.452
你們知道自己的團隊和任務

奪回寶石，救他們回來

1009
01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.207
來回一趟
One round-trip each.

1010
01:05:57.374 --> 01:05:58.458
不准出錯
No mistakes...

1011
01:05:58.958 --> 01:06:00.669
不能重來
no do-overs.

1012
01:06:00.835 --> 01:06:02.712
我們大多會去我們熟悉的地方
Most of us are going somewhere we know.

1013
01:06:02.879 --> 01:06:04.714
那不表示我們能預測會遇到什麼
That doesn't mean we should know what to expect.

1014
01:06:05.882 --> 01:06:06.883
萬事小心
Be careful.

1015
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:08.802
彼此照應
Look out for each other.

這是我們畢生最大的戰役

1017

只許成功
and we're gonna win.

1018
01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:17.686

追蹤器就緒
Trackers engaged.

1024
01:06:30.782 --> 01:06:32.617
你保證把它完整帶回來？
You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?

1025
01:06:32.784 --> 01:06:34.119
對啦…
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
01:06:34.285 --> 01:06:36.162
好，我會盡力
Okay, I'll do my best.

1027
01:06:36.329 --> 01:06:38.123
這種保證真沒說服力
As promises go, that was pretty lame.

1028
01:06:41.209 --> 01:06:42.335
待會見
See ya in a minute.

1029

我們各有任務在身

1031
01:07:38.224 --> 01:07:40.435
兩顆寶石在上城，一顆在下城
Two stones uptown, one stone down.

1032
01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:42.562
保持低調，注意時間
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

1033
01:07:57.994 --> 01:07:59.788
也許過程中砸爛幾樣東西
Maybe smash a few things along the way.

1034
01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:02.916
我覺得太超過，不過隨便啦
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.

1035
01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:33.822
走那邊要小心，地板剛打過蠟
I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.

1036
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.787
我找奇異博士
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

你早來了五年
You're about five years too early.

史蒂芬史傳奇正在20條街以外開刀
Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about 20 blocks that way.

1039

找他有什麼事？
What do you want from him?

1040
01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:54.467
要那個東西
That, actually.

1041
01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:58.680
恐怕不行
Ah! I'm afraid not.

1042
01:08:59.097 --> 01:09:00.473
抱歉，我不是在問妳
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1043
01:09:01.391 --> 01:09:02.392
最好別這麼做
You don't want to do this.

1044
01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:04.144
對，但我需要那寶石
Ah, you're right, I don't. But I need that stone...

1045
01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:05.812
沒時間跟妳辯
and I don't have time to debate it.

1046
01:09:14.821 --> 01:09:16.406
我們重新來過吧？
Let's start over, shall we?

1047
01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:21.578
（阿斯嘉，2013年）

1048

給妳的，珍夫人
For you, Lady Jane.

1049
01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:32.005
你們有搭長褲的嗎？
Um, so you have anything with pants?

1050
01:09:32.172 --> 01:09:33.214
長褲？
Pants?

1051
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.467
算了，這件可以，謝謝
Never mind. These will be fine. Thank you.

1052
01:09:35.633 --> 01:09:37.260
-是，夫人 -那是珍
- Yes, milady. - Oh, there's Jane.

1053
01:09:38.887 --> 01:09:39.888
好
All right.

1054
01:09:41.473 --> 01:09:42.724
這樣吧，肥仔
Here's the deal, tubby.

1055
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:45.268
你去引誘她，我用這個捅她
You're gonna charm her, and I'm gonna poke her with this thing...

1056
01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.896
搶走現實寶石就閃人
and extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.

1057
01:09:49.647 --> 01:09:52.609
我馬上回來，酒窖就在下面
I'll be right back, okay? The wine cellar is just down here.

1058
01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:55.653
家父以前有一大桶阿孔麥芽啤酒
My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1059
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.072
我去廚房找外帶杯
I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups.

1060
01:09:57.238 --> 01:09:59.115
喂！你喝得不夠茫嗎？
Hey. Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

1061
01:10:06.498 --> 01:10:08.416
-請妳送湯給洛基 -是，夫人
If you could send Loki some soup. Yes, milady.

請圖書館員拿些天文學的書
And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1063
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.303
那個美魔女是誰？
Who's the fancy broad?

1064
01:10:21.638 --> 01:10:23.139
那是我母親
That's my mother.

1065
01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.350
她今天去世
She dies today.

1066
01:10:26.017 --> 01:10:27.811
那是今天？
Oh, that is today?

1067
01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:36.903
我做不到…
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1068
01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:39.030
我不該在這裡，我不該來
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.

1069
01:10:39.197 --> 01:10:40.323
這是個餿主意
It's a bad idea!

1070
01:10:40.615 --> 01:10:41.658
-過來 -不…
- Come here. - No, no, no.

1071
01:10:41.825 --> 01:10:44.244
我恐慌發作了
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1072
01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:46.413
-過來這裡 -我不該來的，這樣不對
Come here. Right here. I shouldn't be here. This is bad.

1073
01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:48.832
難道只有你失去親友嗎？
You think you're the only one who lost people?

1074
01:10:48.998 --> 01:10:50.834
你以為我們在這裡做什麼？
What do you think we're doing here?

1075
01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:53.169
我失去我僅有的家人
I lost the only family I ever had.

1076
01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:55.755
奎爾、格魯特、德克斯、長觸角的妞
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...

我知道你想你媽
I get you miss your mom...

1079
01:10:59.676 --> 01:11:00.885
可是她走了
but she's gone.

1080
01:11:01.052 --> 01:11:02.053
真的走了
Really gone.

1081
01:11:02.637 --> 01:11:05.473
有很多人只是消失
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...

1082
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.766
你能救他們
and you can help them.

1083
01:11:07.892 --> 01:11:11.104
所以請你刷掉鬍鬚上的碎屑
So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1084
01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:13.565
去跟那個褲子姊喇低賽
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1085
01:11:14.024 --> 01:11:16.901
趁她不注意時拿走無限寶石
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...

1086
01:11:17.068 --> 01:11:18.653
救我家人回來，行嗎？
and help me get my family back?

1087
01:11:20.321 --> 01:11:21.322
好
Okay.

1088
01:11:21.614 --> 01:11:22.615
你哭了？
Are you crying?

1089
01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:24.534
哪有
No.

1090
01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:27.537
對啦
Yes.

1091
01:11:27.704 --> 01:11:28.913
我快淚崩了
I feel like I'm losing it.

1092
01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.081
振作一點
Get it together!

1093
01:11:30.248 --> 01:11:31.249

你做得到
You can do this.

1095
01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:37.922
好不好？
All right?

1096
01:11:38.089 --> 01:11:39.090
對，我可以
Yes, I can.

很好
Good.

1098
01:11:42.469 --> 01:11:44.804
我做得到…
I can do this. I can do this.

1099
01:11:45.638 --> 01:11:47.098
我做不到
I can't do this.

1100
01:11:47.265 --> 01:11:50.685
撩妹王，她落單，機會來了
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.

降落，藍臉妹
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1104
01:12:05.241 --> 01:12:07.660
降在線上，下去
Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

1105
01:12:12.957 --> 01:12:14.000
可以快點嗎？
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1106
01:12:14.167 --> 01:12:16.252
動作快，我們趕時間
Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on the clock.

1107
01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:18.171
這樣嗆聲很有幫助喔
All that is really helpful.

1108
01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:21.883
-保重 -好
- Take care, okay? - Yeah.

1109
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:24.511
把寶石拿回來，別玩瘋了
Get that stone and come back. No messing around.

You guys watch each other's six.

01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:33.520
好
Yeah.

1115

佛米爾星的座標已儲存
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1116

他們只要別起衝突就好
All they have to do is not fall out.

1117

01:13:06.594 --> 01:13:08.430
他就會帶我們去找力量寶石，對吧？
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1121
01:13:09.431 --> 01:13:10.849
我們找掩護
Let's take cover.

1122
01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:14.936
2014年不只有我們在找寶石
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1123
01:13:15.103 --> 01:13:16.354
等一下，妳在說什麼？
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?

1124
01:13:16.521 --> 01:13:17.856
還有誰在找這些寶石？
Who else is looking for these stones?

1125
01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:22.902
我父親
My father...

1126
01:13:23.069 --> 01:13:24.863
我姊
my sister...

1127
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:26.156
和我
and me.

1128
01:13:26.322 --> 01:13:27.490
妳？
And you?

1129
01:13:29.367 --> 01:13:30.952
妳現在在哪裡？
Where are you right now?

1130
01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:00.815
別客氣
You're welcome.

1131
01:14:00.982 --> 01:14:03.276
我沒請妳幫忙
I didn't ask for your help.

1132
01:14:03.943 --> 01:14:05.570
但妳一向需要幫忙
And yet, you always need it.

1133
01:14:09.616 --> 01:14:11.618
起來，父親要我們回船上
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1134
01:14:11.785 --> 01:14:12.786
為什麼？
Why?

1135
01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:14.954
他發現了一顆無限寶石
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1136
01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.877
在哪裡？
Where?

1137
01:14:21.044 --> 01:14:22.796
一個叫莫拉格的星球
On a planet called Morag.

1138
01:14:24.422 --> 01:14:26.341
父親的計畫終於啟動了
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1139
01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:28.510
才一顆寶石而已，涅布拉
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1140
01:14:28.677 --> 01:14:29.886
總是個開始
It's a start.

1141
01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:31.846
如果他全部拿到手…
If he gets all of them...

1142
01:14:44.859 --> 01:14:48.405
羅南發現力量寶石位置，我派妳們去他船上
Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1143
01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.781
他會不高興
He won't like that.

1144
01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:52.075
那他就別想活了
His alternative is death.

1145
01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:55.328
羅南的執迷
Ronan's obsession...

1146
01:14:56.371 --> 01:14:58.540
影響了他的判斷力
clouds his judgment.

1147
01:15:02.961 --> 01:15:04.754
我們不會讓你失望，父親
We will not fail you, Father.

1148
01:15:05.797 --> 01:15:07.424
妳們不會
No, you won't.

1149
01:15:10.135 --> 01:15:11.136
我發誓…
I swear...

1150
01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:14.931
我會讓你感到驕傲
I will make you proud.

1151
01:15:23.314 --> 01:15:26.985
我們等奎爾出現
...we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1152
01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:29.154
他會帶我們去找力量寶石，對吧？
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1153
01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.905
我們找掩護
Let's take cover.

1154
01:15:31.906 --> 01:15:34.784
2014年不只有我們在找寶石
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1155
01:15:37.203 --> 01:15:38.663
那是誰？
Who was that?

1156
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:39.831
我不知道
I don't know.

1157
01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:42.167
我頭痛欲裂，不知道
My head is splitting. I don't know.

1158
01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:46.588
她的突觸硬碟大概在打鬥時受損
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.

1159
01:15:47.807 --> 01:15:49.274
Shh.

1160
01:15:56.848 --> 01:15:58.892
帶她到我船上
Bring her to my ship.

1161
01:16:06.824 --> 01:16:07.359
最好快點，隊長
Better hustle, Cap.

1162
01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:09.611
看來他們這裡要結束了
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.

1163
01:16:09.778 --> 01:16:11.404
瞭解，我正接近電梯
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

1164
01:16:17.869 --> 01:16:19.454
如果對你來說沒差…
If it's all the same to you...

1165
01:16:21.748 --> 01:16:23.291
我現在就喝那杯酒
I'll have that drink now.

1166
01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:25.293
好，讓他站起來
All right, get him on his feet.

1167
01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.463
其他的晚一點再說
We can all stand around posing up a storm later.

1168
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:29.964
盡量清理一下
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1169
01:16:30.882 --> 01:16:33.134
羅傑斯先生，我差點忘了這套服裝…
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit...

1170
01:16:33.301 --> 01:16:35.220
完全沒讓你屁股變翹
did nothing for your ass.

1171
01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:36.513
沒人叫你看，東尼
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1172
01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.306
-太可笑了 -你很帥，隊長
It's ridiculous. I think you look great, Cap.

1173
01:16:38.765 --> 01:16:41.267
我認為那就是美國翹臀
As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.

1174
01:16:41.476 --> 01:16:43.395
誰拿魔杖？
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1175
01:16:43.561 --> 01:16:44.604
神盾局團隊來保護它了
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it.

1176
01:16:55.782 --> 01:16:57.534
我們能幫妳保管
We can take that off your hands.

1177
01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:58.702
請便
By all means.

1178
01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:02.664
小心那玩意
Careful with that thing.

1179
01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:04.290
除非你想讓心智被抹除
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1180
01:17:04.457 --> 01:17:05.458
那可不好玩
And not in a fun way.

1181
01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:06.626
我們保證會小心
We promise to be careful.

1182
01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:07.794
這些人是誰？
Who are these guys?

1183
01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:09.254
他們是神盾局的
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1184
01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:12.507
其實是九頭蛇，但當時我們不知道
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet.

1185
01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:14.843
真假？你們不知道？
Seriously? You didn't?

1186
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.511
他們一副壞蛋臉
I mean, they look like bad guys.

1187
01:17:16.678 --> 01:17:18.096
你個子小，嗓門卻很大
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1188
01:17:18.263 --> 01:17:20.098
我下去協調搜救行動
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1189
01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:22.225
我下去協調搜救行動
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1190
01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:24.853
說真的，你怎麼沒吐出來？
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?

1191
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.438
閉嘴
Shut up.

1192
01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:28.314
該你上場了，小兄弟
Ooh. All right, you're up, little buddy.

1193
01:17:28.481 --> 01:17:30.608
我們的寶石在那裡
There's our stone.

1194
01:17:30.775 --> 01:17:31.776
好
All right.

1195
01:17:31.943 --> 01:17:33.111
彈我出去
Flick me.

1196
01:17:47.208 --> 01:17:48.209
讓開
- Move. - Hey.

1197
01:17:48.376 --> 01:17:50.128
兄弟
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Hey, hey. Buddy!

1198
01:17:50.295 --> 01:17:52.088
你覺得呢？已達人數上限
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1199
01:17:52.255 --> 01:17:53.256
走樓梯
Take the stairs.

1200
01:17:53.423 --> 01:17:55.300
對啊，停…
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1201
01:17:58.053 --> 01:18:00.847
走樓梯，我討厭樓梯
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1202
01:18:04.559 --> 01:18:06.936
隊長，我看到權杖在電梯裡
All right, Cap, I got our sceptre in the elevator...

1203
01:18:07.103 --> 01:18:08.897
剛經過80樓
just passing the 80th floor.

1204
01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:10.690
馬上去
On it.

1205
01:18:11.524 --> 01:18:13.401
-前往大廳 -到那裡見
Head to the lobby. All right,

1206
01:18:13.777 --> 01:18:15.362
證據安全無虞
I'll see you there. Evidence secure.

1207
01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:16.946
我們正要去找李斯特博士
We're en route to Doctor List.

1208
01:18:17.655 --> 01:18:20.533
完全沒耽誤，局長
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1209
01:18:25.955 --> 01:18:26.706
隊長
Captain.

1210
01:18:26.873 --> 01:18:28.917
我以為你在協調搜救行動
I thought you were coordinating

1211
01:18:29.084 --> 01:18:30.627
計畫有變
search and rescue. Change of plans.

1212
01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:35.882
隊長
Hey, Cap.

1213
01:18:37.175 --> 01:18:38.218
朗姆洛
Rumlow.

1214
01:18:44.516 --> 01:18:46.351
我剛接到局長的電話
I just got a call from the secretary.

1215
01:18:46.518 --> 01:18:48.395
由我主導保護權杖的行動
I'm gonna be running point on the sceptre.

1216
01:18:50.897 --> 01:18:53.149
長官？我不懂
Sir? I don't understand.

1217
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:57.445
據說有人想竊取它
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

1218
01:18:57.612 --> 01:18:59.197
抱歉，隊長
Sorry, Cap.

1219
01:18:59.364 --> 01:19:00.782
權杖不能交給你
We can't give you the sceptre.

1220
01:19:01.366 --> 01:19:03.243
我必須聯絡局長
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1221
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.537
沒關係，相信我
That's okay. Trust me.

1222
01:19:09.124 --> 01:19:10.041
九頭蛇萬歲
Hail Hydra.

1223
01:19:24.764 --> 01:19:26.641
好多階樓梯！
So many stairs!

1224
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:40.989
拇指姑娘，收到了嗎？我看到目標了
Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize.

1225
01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:42.240
該行動了
It is go time.

1226
01:19:42.407 --> 01:19:43.408
馬上去
Bombs away.

1227
01:19:50.665 --> 01:19:53.043
那是體香劑嗎？
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1228
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:55.420
我桌子有一罐以備不時之需，放輕鬆
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Relax.

1229
01:19:55.587 --> 01:19:56.671
可以專心點嗎？
Can we focus, please?

1230
01:19:56.838 --> 01:19:58.089
我要進入你體內…
I'm going inside you...

1231
01:19:58.798 --> 01:19:59.799
現在
now.

1232
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.140
請問你們要去哪裡？
Uh, may I ask you where you're going?

1233
01:20:07.307 --> 01:20:09.559
先吃午飯再去阿斯嘉，你是？
Bit of lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are...?

1234
01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:10.727
亞歷山大皮爾斯
Alexander Pierce.

1235
01:20:10.894 --> 01:20:13.355
他是尼克福瑞背後那批人的上級
He's the man above the folks - behind Nick Fury. - Oh.

1236
01:20:13.521 --> 01:20:14.647
我朋友叫我局長先生
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1237
01:20:14.814 --> 01:20:17.192
我得要求你把那位囚犯交給我
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.

1238
01:20:17.609 --> 01:20:19.152
洛基會向奧丁本人報到
Uh, Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1239
01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:21.696
他向我們報到，其他人可交給奧丁
No, he's going to answer to us. Odin can have what's left.

1240
01:20:21.863 --> 01:20:23.323
我也需要那個手提箱
And I'm gonna need that case.

1241
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.283
70多年來它都是神盾局財產
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property for over 70 years.

1242
01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:26.659
手提箱交出來，史塔克
Hand over the case, Stark.

1243
01:20:26.826 --> 01:20:29.204
動作快，一家之鼠，情況變棘手，快
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

1244
01:20:29.371 --> 01:20:31.081
我不想爭論誰層級較高…
I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here...

1245
01:20:31.539 --> 01:20:32.832
你保證你不會死？
You promise me you won't die?

1246
01:20:32.999 --> 01:20:35.710
我只會輕微心律不整
We're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1247
01:20:35.877 --> 01:20:37.462
聽起來並不輕微
That doesn't sound mild.

1248
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:38.630
我需要那個箱子
I need the case.

1249
01:20:38.797 --> 01:20:40.173
我知道你很大咖，但是管轄權…
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying,

1250
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.508
那就把箱子給我
- jurisdiction... - Okay, then give me the case.

1251
01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.718
-管轄權… -交出來
Well, jurisdiction...

1252
01:20:43.885 --> 01:20:44.803
快點！朗恩
Hand it over. Do it, Lang!

1253
01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:46.763
-放開我 -沒時間了，拉我的開關
Get your hands off me. Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1254
01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:49.182
來囉
Here goes!

1255
01:20:52.018 --> 01:20:53.561
-史塔克？ -史塔克？
- Stark? - Stark?

1256
01:20:54.896 --> 01:20:55.980
他在抽搐，讓他透透氣
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1257
01:20:56.147 --> 01:20:57.857
-醫護員 -醫護員
- Medic! - Medic!

1258
01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.776
過來幫忙
Give these guys some help.

1259
01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:01.152
說話啊
Speak to me.

1260
01:21:01.611 --> 01:21:03.405
史塔克，是你胸部的機器嗎？
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1261
01:21:06.157 --> 01:21:07.492
呼吸…
Breathe, breathe.

1262
01:21:12.747 --> 01:21:15.083
很好，小巷見，我去吃片披薩
Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1263
01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:22.507
不要走樓梯！
No stairs!

1264
01:21:30.724 --> 01:21:32.142
史塔克，撐下去
Uh... Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1265
01:21:32.308 --> 01:21:34.269
我要試一個辦法，不知道有沒有用
I'm going to try something. Okay? I have no idea if it's going to work.

1266
01:21:36.271 --> 01:21:37.147
太好了！
Yes!

1267
01:21:37.313 --> 01:21:38.690
一拍見效
Oh, that worked a treat.

1268
01:21:38.857 --> 01:21:39.858
好誇張
Dude, that was so crazy.

1269
01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:41.401
我也不知道有沒有用
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1270
01:21:41.568 --> 01:21:43.445
-手提箱 -手提箱…
- The case. - The case is, uh...

1271
01:21:43.611 --> 01:21:45.613
手提箱在哪？洛基呢？
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

1272
01:21:46.614 --> 01:21:47.615
洛基！
Loki!

1273
01:21:47.782 --> 01:21:48.950
那不該發生吧？
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

1274
01:21:49.117 --> 01:21:50.243
我們搞砸了
Oh, we blew it.

1275
01:21:50.410 --> 01:21:51.911
洛基？
Loki?

1276
01:21:53.955 --> 01:21:55.248
東尼，怎麼回事？
Tony, what's going on?

1277
01:21:56.249 --> 01:21:57.917
跟我說你找到了那方塊
Tell me you found that Cube.

1278
01:22:00.795 --> 01:22:02.213
開什麼玩笑
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

1279
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:08.511
我看到洛基，14樓
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1280
01:22:08.678 --> 01:22:10.055
我不是洛基
I'm not Loki...

1281
01:22:13.641 --> 01:22:15.268
我不想傷害你
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1282
01:22:24.194 --> 01:22:25.195
我可以陪你慢慢玩
I can do this all day.

1283
01:22:25.362 --> 01:22:26.654
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1284
01:22:26.821 --> 01:22:27.822
我知道
I know.

1285
01:23:00.563 --> 01:23:01.564
你怎麼有這個？
Where did you get this?

1286
01:23:12.867 --> 01:23:15.912
巴奇還活著
Bucky is alive.

1287
01:23:19.457 --> 01:23:20.500
什麼？
What?

1288
01:23:35.432 --> 01:23:36.975
明明就是美國翹臀
That is America's ass.

1289
01:23:41.354 --> 01:23:42.355
求求妳
Please, please.

1290
01:23:42.522 --> 01:23:44.399
抱歉我幫不上忙，布魯斯
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

1291
01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:48.570
放棄時間寶石來幫助你的現實，會危及我自己
If I give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1292
01:23:48.737 --> 01:23:50.488
我有話直說
With all due respect, all right...

1293
01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:53.742
我覺得科學無法支持這一點
I'm not sure the science really supports that.

1294
01:23:59.372 --> 01:24:03.668
無限寶石創造了你體驗到的時間流
The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time.

1295
01:24:03.835 --> 01:24:05.378
移除一顆寶石
Remove one of the stones...

1296
01:24:05.545 --> 01:24:07.630
時間流便會分裂
and that flow splits.

1297
01:24:07.797 --> 01:24:10.258
它或許有利於你的現實
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1298
01:24:10.425 --> 01:24:12.552
卻不利我的新現實
but my new one, not so much.

1299
01:24:12.927 --> 01:24:14.637
在這新的分支現實
In this new branch reality...

1300
01:24:14.804 --> 01:24:17.891
少了對抗黑暗力量的主要武器
without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness...

1301
01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:20.226
我們的世界將慘遭蹂躪
our world would be overrun.

1302
01:24:20.393 --> 01:24:22.103
千百萬人將受苦受難
Millions will suffer.

1303
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.521
告訴我，博士
So, tell me, Doctor.

1304
01:24:24.105 --> 01:24:26.274
你的科學能預防這一切嗎？
Can your science prevent all that?

1305
01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:27.442
不能
No...

1306
01:24:28.443 --> 01:24:29.569
但我們能抹除它
but we can erase it.

1307
01:24:29.736 --> 01:24:31.446
一旦取回寶石
Because once we're done with the stones...

1308
01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:33.782
我們能將它們送回自己的時間軸
we can return each one to its own timeline...

1309
01:24:33.948 --> 01:24:35.450
回到它們被奪走的時刻
at the moment it was taken.

1310
01:24:35.617 --> 01:24:38.078
所以，在時間上
So, chronologically...

1311
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.163
在那個現實裡
in that reality...

1312
01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:44.417
它從未離開
it never left.

1313
01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:49.881
但你遺漏了最重要的部分
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part.

1314
01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:55.929
想要送回寶石，你們必須存活
In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

1315
01:24:56.096 --> 01:24:58.682
我們會的，我會，我保證
We will. I will. I promise.

1316
01:24:59.516 --> 01:25:01.559
我不能靠保證讓這個現實冒險
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1317
01:25:03.228 --> 01:25:07.857
保護時間寶石是至尊魔法師的責任
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

1318
01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:10.110
那史傳奇為何把它交出去？
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1319
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:13.154
你說什麼？
What did you say?

1320
01:25:13.321 --> 01:25:15.657
史傳奇，他把它交給薩諾斯
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

1321
01:25:16.282 --> 01:25:17.867
-自願的？ -對
- Willingly? - Yes.

1322
01:25:21.788 --> 01:25:23.373
-為什麼？ -我不知道
- Why? - I have no idea.

1323
01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:25.291
或許他犯了錯
Maybe he made a mistake.

1324
01:25:35.427 --> 01:25:36.720
也許是我犯了錯
Or I did.

1325
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:59.409
史傳奇應該是我們當中最優秀的
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1326
01:25:59.576 --> 01:26:02.078
那他那麼做必定有原因
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1327
01:26:02.871 --> 01:26:04.497
恐怕沒錯
I fear you might be right.

1328
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:10.670
謝謝
Thank you.

1329
01:26:16.926 --> 01:26:18.595
我就指望你了，布魯斯
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1330
01:26:20.638 --> 01:26:21.848
我們都是
We all are.

1331
01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:43.870
進行診斷
Run diagnostics.

1332
01:26:44.621 --> 01:26:46.581
呈現她的記憶檔案
Show me her memory file.

1333
01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:50.627
老大，檔案顯得非常亂
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1334
01:26:51.795 --> 01:26:53.755
是記憶，卻不是她的
It was a memory, but not hers.

1335
01:26:55.006 --> 01:26:56.424
有另一個意識…
There's another consciousness...

1336
01:26:56.591 --> 01:26:57.884
在共用她的網絡
sharing her network.

1337
01:26:58.426 --> 01:26:59.761
另一個涅布拉
Another Nebula.

1338
01:27:01.888 --> 01:27:03.348
不可能
Impossible.

1339
01:27:03.515 --> 01:27:06.142
這個分身有一個時間戳記
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1340
01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.229
來自九年後
from nine years in the future.

1341
01:27:13.817 --> 01:27:16.319
另一個涅布拉在哪裡？
Where is this other Nebula?

1342
01:27:16.986 --> 01:27:18.988
在我們太陽系，莫拉格星
In our solar system on Morag.

1343
01:27:20.532 --> 01:27:21.825
你能進入她的記憶嗎？
Can you access her?

1344
01:27:21.991 --> 01:27:24.035
可以，兩者相連
Yes, the two are linked.

1345
01:27:24.202 --> 01:27:26.287
搜尋分身的記憶…
Search the duplicate's memories...

1346
01:27:26.454 --> 01:27:28.665
找出無限寶石
for Infinity Stones.

1347
01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:35.171
這些寶石在歷史上許多地方出現過
And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

1348
01:27:35.338 --> 01:27:36.339
我們的歷史
Our history.

1349
01:27:36.506 --> 01:27:38.633
容易前往的時間點…
So, not a lot of convenient spots

1350
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.926
並不多
to just drop in.

1351
01:27:40.093 --> 01:27:41.761
所以我們必須挑選目標
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1352
01:27:41.928 --> 01:27:43.221
-沒錯 -暫停影像
- Correct. - Freeze image.

1353
01:27:45.181 --> 01:27:46.391
地球人
Terrans.

1354
01:27:47.475 --> 01:27:49.144
復仇者聯盟
Avengers.

1355
01:27:50.228 --> 01:27:51.938
任性的下流胚子
Unruly wretches.

1356
01:27:52.105 --> 01:27:53.606
那反射影像是什麼？
What's that reflection?

1357
01:27:55.233 --> 01:27:56.401
強化它，烏木喉
Amplify this, Maw.

1358
01:27:59.904 --> 01:28:01.114
我不懂
I don't understand.

1359
01:28:05.827 --> 01:28:07.412
兩個涅布拉
Two Nebulas.

1360
01:28:07.579 --> 01:28:09.998
不，同一個涅布拉
No. The same Nebula...

1361
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:12.542
來自兩個不同時間
from two different times.

1362
01:28:13.835 --> 01:28:15.462
航向莫拉格星
Set course for Morag.

1363
01:28:15.628 --> 01:28:18.006
掃描分身的記憶
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1364
01:28:18.757 --> 01:28:21.134
我想看個一清二楚
I wanna see everything.

1365
01:28:30.935 --> 01:28:34.397
回頭見，妳們走吧
My ladies, I'll see you after. I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1366
01:28:48.787 --> 01:28:49.788
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?

1367
01:28:51.414 --> 01:28:52.624
天啊
Oh, God!

1368
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:55.251
不要學你弟偷溜
You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1369
01:28:55.418 --> 01:28:57.295
我沒有偷溜，我想去散步
No, I wasn't sneaking. I was just going for a walk.

1370
01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:58.797
你穿這是什麼？
What are you wearing?

1371
01:28:58.963 --> 01:29:01.341
我常穿這個，我最喜歡的
I always wear this. It's one of my favourites.

1372
01:29:05.428 --> 01:29:06.805
你眼睛怎麼了？
Mm... What's wrong with your eye?

1373
01:29:06.971 --> 01:29:07.972
我的眼睛
Oh, my eye.

1374
01:29:08.139 --> 01:29:10.100
記得哈洛金戰役
Remember the, uh, Battle of Harokin...

1375
01:29:10.266 --> 01:29:13.353
我的臉被大刀砍傷嗎？
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword?

1376
01:29:16.898 --> 01:29:18.942
你根本不是我認識的索爾吧？
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1377
01:29:19.693 --> 01:29:21.444
我是
Yes, I am.

1378
01:29:21.945 --> 01:29:24.447
你在未來過得不好，對吧？
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1379
01:29:24.906 --> 01:29:26.825
我沒說我來自未來
I didn't say I was from the future.

1380
01:29:27.283 --> 01:29:29.828
我是女巫養大的，孩子
I was raised by witches, boy.

1381
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:33.248
你知道我不只用眼睛看
I see with more than eyes, you know that.

1382
01:29:35.333 --> 01:29:37.585
對，我就是來自未來
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1383
01:29:37.752 --> 01:29:39.379
你是，親愛的
Yes, you are, honey.

1384
01:29:39.546 --> 01:29:41.047
我真的很需要跟妳談
I really need to talk to you.

1385
01:29:41.214 --> 01:29:42.215
我們可以談談
We can talk.

1386
01:30:06.364 --> 01:30:08.324
他的頭在那裡
His head was over there...

1387
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:11.453
身體在那邊
and his body over there...

1388
01:30:12.746 --> 01:30:15.248
有什麼意義呢？我太遲了
I mean, what was the point? I was too late.

1389
01:30:15.915 --> 01:30:17.542
我只是杵在那裡
I was just standing there.

1390
01:30:18.501 --> 01:30:20.253
一個拿著斧頭的白癡
Some idiot with an axe.

1391
01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.130
你不是白癡
Now, you're no idiot.

1392
01:30:23.256 --> 01:30:24.841
你不是來了嗎？
You're here, aren't you?

1393
01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:27.510
向阿斯嘉最睿智的人徵詢意見
Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.

1394
01:30:27.844 --> 01:30:28.887
對
I am. Yes.

1395
01:30:29.054 --> 01:30:30.388
白癡，不是
Idiot, no.

1396
01:30:30.555 --> 01:30:32.057
失敗者？
A failure?

1397
01:30:32.223 --> 01:30:33.350
當然
Absolutely.

1398
01:30:33.516 --> 01:30:35.310
有點傷人
That's a little bit harsh.

1399
01:30:35.477 --> 01:30:36.978
這讓你成了什麼呢？
Do you know what that makes you?

1400
01:30:38.188 --> 01:30:40.190
跟其他人沒兩樣
Just like everyone else.

1401
01:30:40.357 --> 01:30:43.234
我不該跟其他人沒兩樣吧？
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

1402
01:30:43.735 --> 01:30:46.905
每個人都無法成為理想中的自己，索爾
Mm. Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1403
01:30:47.614 --> 01:30:50.658
衡量一個人，一個英雄
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1404
01:30:50.825 --> 01:30:54.204
要看他們是否成功做自己
is how well they succeed at being who they are.

1405
01:30:59.459 --> 01:31:00.919
我真的好想妳，媽
I've really missed you, Mom.

1406
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.551
索爾！我拿到了
Thor! I got it!

1407
01:31:09.427 --> 01:31:10.970
抓住那隻兔子
Get that rabbit!

1408
01:31:13.973 --> 01:31:15.558
媽，我得告訴妳一件事
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1409
01:31:15.725 --> 01:31:17.519
兒子，你不必說
No, son, you don't.

1410
01:31:17.686 --> 01:31:20.188
你是來修補你的未來，不是我的
You're here to repair your future, not mine.

1411
01:31:20.355 --> 01:31:22.023
這關乎妳的未來
This is about your future.

1412
01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:23.525
與我無關
Uh, it's none of my business.

1413
01:31:27.529 --> 01:31:28.780
妳好
Hi.

1414
01:31:28.947 --> 01:31:30.949
妳一定是索爾的媽
You must be Mom.

1415
01:31:31.116 --> 01:31:32.575
我拿到了，我們快走
I got the thing. Come on. We gotta move.

1416
01:31:32.742 --> 01:31:34.202
真希望能留久一點
Oh, I wish we had more time.

1417
01:31:34.369 --> 01:31:36.204
不，這是上天的恩賜
No, this was a gift.

1418
01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:39.791
去承擔你該當的角色吧
Now you go and be the man you're meant to be.

1419
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:41.334
我愛妳，媽
I love you, Mom.

1420
01:31:41.501 --> 01:31:42.419
我愛你
I love you.

1421
01:31:46.881 --> 01:31:48.800
多吃沙拉
And eat a salad.

1422
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:50.927
我們該走了
Come on, we gotta go.

1423
01:31:51.094 --> 01:31:52.679
-再見 -三…
- Goodbye. - Three...

1424
01:31:52.846 --> 01:31:53.930
-二… -不，等等！
- Two... - No, wait!

1425
01:31:57.183 --> 01:31:58.393
現在是怎樣？
What am I looking at?

1426
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.020
有時需要一下子
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

1427
01:32:09.904 --> 01:32:11.531
我還有資格
I'm still worthy.

1428
01:32:12.949 --> 01:32:14.576
天啊
Oh, boy.

1429
01:32:15.744 --> 01:32:17.662
-再見，媽 -再見
- Goodbye, Mom. - Goodbye.

1430
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:58.536
所以他是白癡？
So, he's an idiot?

1431
01:32:59.871 --> 01:33:01.289
嗯
Yeah.

1432
01:33:09.798 --> 01:33:11.007
那是什麼？
What's that?

1433
01:33:11.174 --> 01:33:13.051
小偷的傢伙
The tool of a thief.

1434
01:33:20.811 --> 01:33:24.437
這時牆面會有尖刺伸出來
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is the part where spikes come out...

1435
01:33:24.604 --> 01:33:26.022
尾端還有骷髏
with skeletons on the end of them and everything.

1436
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:27.399
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

1437
01:33:27.565 --> 01:33:29.901
闖入力量寶石神殿時
When you break into a place called "The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1438
01:33:30.068 --> 01:33:31.361
一定會有不少陷阱
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1439
01:33:31.528 --> 01:33:33.780
-天啊 -好吧，妳走吧
- Oh, my God. - Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1440
01:34:07.063 --> 01:34:08.565
我並非一直這副模樣
I wasn't always like this.

1441
01:34:09.482 --> 01:34:10.483
我也不是
Me either.

1442
01:34:12.277 --> 01:34:13.737
我們只能物盡其用，對吧？
But we work with what we got, right?

1443
01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:19.159
一起
Hmm. Let's sync up.

1444
01:34:21.036 --> 01:34:23.496
三，二，一
Three, two, one.

1445
01:34:36.343 --> 01:34:37.969
你謀殺了數十億人
You murdered trillions!

1446
01:34:38.136 --> 01:34:39.554
你應該心存感激
You should be grateful.

1447
01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:42.766
寶石在哪裡？
Where are the stones?

1448
01:34:42.932 --> 01:34:43.933
灰飛煙滅
Gone.

1449
01:34:44.684 --> 01:34:45.685
縮小成原子
Reduced to atoms.

1450
01:34:46.394 --> 01:34:48.063
兩天前你才用過它們
You used them two days ago!

1451
01:34:48.355 --> 01:34:51.358
我用寶石來摧毀寶石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

1452
01:34:51.524 --> 01:34:53.360
差點害我沒命
It nearly killed me.

1453
01:34:53.526 --> 01:34:55.445
但任務結束了
But the work is done.

1454
01:34:55.612 --> 01:34:57.447
總是會結束的
It always will be.

1455
01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:02.202
我是無可匹敵的
I am inevitable.

1456
01:35:03.453 --> 01:35:05.497
你對他們做了什麼？
What did you do to them?

1457
01:35:05.663 --> 01:35:06.915
沒有
Nothing.

1458
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:09.084
還沒
Yet.

1459
01:35:10.877 --> 01:35:14.589
他們不是想阻止我即將做的事
They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time.

1460
01:35:14.923 --> 01:35:18.551
他們想逆轉我在他們那時候已經做的事
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.

1461
01:35:18.718 --> 01:35:20.387
寶石
The stones.

1462
01:35:21.304 --> 01:35:23.223
我全都找到了
I found them all.

1463
01:35:25.016 --> 01:35:26.393
我贏了
I won.

1464
01:35:27.143 --> 01:35:30.105
讓宇宙達到平衡
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

1465
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:35.860
這是您的未來
This is your future.

1466
01:35:36.194 --> 01:35:38.238
這是我的天命
It's my destiny.

1467
01:35:39.447 --> 01:35:41.491
我父親有很多面向
My father is many things.

1468
01:35:41.658 --> 01:35:43.493
卻不會說謊
A liar is not one of them.

1469
01:35:47.205 --> 01:35:49.124
謝謝妳，女兒
Ah. Thank you, daughter.

1470
01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:51.459
或許我對妳太嚴厲了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

1471
01:35:55.964 --> 01:35:58.842
天命就此實現
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1472
01:35:59.259 --> 01:36:00.635
老大
Sire...

1473
01:36:00.802 --> 01:36:01.928
您女兒…
your daughter...

1474
01:36:04.389 --> 01:36:05.390
不！
No!

1475
01:36:05.849 --> 01:36:06.891
是叛徒
...is a traitor.

1476
01:36:07.058 --> 01:36:09.519
那不是我，我不可能…
That's not me. It's not, I could never...

1477
01:36:09.686 --> 01:36:10.854
我絕對不會背叛你
I would never betray you.

1478
01:36:11.021 --> 01:36:12.856
絕對不會
Never. Never.

1479
01:36:18.611 --> 01:36:19.779
我知道
I know.

1480
01:36:20.739 --> 01:36:23.992
妳會有機會證明的
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1481
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:31.374
糟糕
No!

1482
01:36:32.083 --> 01:36:33.293
他知道了
He knows!

1483
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:39.924
巴頓…請回答
Barton! Barton, come in.

1484
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:41.843
羅曼諾夫
Romanoff!

1485
01:36:42.469 --> 01:36:43.887
請回答，我們碰上麻煩了
Come in, we have a problem.

1486
01:36:44.054 --> 01:36:45.180
快啊
Come on!

1487
01:36:45.347 --> 01:36:46.765
請回答，我們碰上…
Come in, we have a...

1488
01:36:46.931 --> 01:36:48.266
薩諾斯知道了
Thanos knows.

1489
01:36:48.933 --> 01:36:50.185
薩諾斯…
Thanos...

1490
01:37:03.907 --> 01:37:04.991
隊長
Cap.

1491
01:37:06.618 --> 01:37:08.870
抱歉，我們碰上問題了
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1492
01:37:09.704 --> 01:37:11.039
真的
Yeah, we do.

1493
01:37:11.623 --> 01:37:12.624
現在怎麼辦？
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1494
01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:13.792
饒了我吧，史帝夫
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1495
01:37:13.958 --> 01:37:15.377
我的頭剛挨了浩克一拳
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1496
01:37:15.543 --> 01:37:16.961
你說我們只有一次機會
You said that we had one shot.

1497
01:37:17.128 --> 01:37:18.463
這就是我們的機會
This was our shot.

1498
01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:20.632
我們試過了，不拿到六顆就沒用
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.

1499
01:37:20.799 --> 01:37:22.175
-不拿到六顆就沒用 -你在鬼打牆
- It was six stones or nothing. - You're repeating yourself,

1500
01:37:22.342 --> 01:37:23.343
你在鬼打牆
you know that? You're repeating yourself.

1501
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:25.220
你才在鬼打牆…
You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself.

1502
01:37:25.387 --> 01:37:27.180
-拜託 -你根本不要時間攔劫
Dude. Come on! No. You never wanted a time heist.

1503
01:37:27.347 --> 01:37:28.348
你不贊成時間攔劫
You weren't on board with the time heist.

1504
01:37:28.515 --> 01:37:29.641
-我錯了 -你毀了時間攔劫
- I dropped the ball. - You ruined the time heist.

1505
01:37:29.808 --> 01:37:31.101
-我有嗎？ -有
- Is that what I did? - Yeah.

1506
01:37:31.267 --> 01:37:33.061
有別的辦法能拿到宇宙魔方嗎？
Are there any other options with the Tesseract?

1507
01:37:33.228 --> 01:37:34.437
沒有別的辦法
No, no, no, there's no other options.

1508
01:37:34.604 --> 01:37:35.855
不能重來
There's no do-overs.

1509
01:37:36.022 --> 01:37:38.108
我們不能亂跑，只剩一管粒子
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left.

1510
01:37:38.274 --> 01:37:39.109
每人一管
Each.

1511
01:37:39.275 --> 01:37:41.569
就這樣，懂嗎？只要用了…
That's it. All right? We use that...

1512
01:37:41.736 --> 01:37:42.904
掰掰，你們就別想回家
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1513
01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:45.031
如果我們不嘗試
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1514
01:37:45.198 --> 01:37:46.366
誰都別想回家
then no one else is going home, either.

1515
01:37:46.533 --> 01:37:47.450
我想到了
I got it.

1516
01:37:48.743 --> 01:37:52.789
有辦法能拿回宇宙魔方，取得新的粒子
There's another way to retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles.

1517
01:37:53.623 --> 01:37:54.666
回憶一下往事
Little stroll down memory lane.

1518
01:37:55.458 --> 01:37:57.293
軍事設施，紐澤西州
Military installation, Garden State.

1519
01:38:01.381 --> 01:38:02.674
他們倆都在那邊的時候？
When were they both there?

1520
01:38:02.841 --> 01:38:05.218
他們曾經在那裡，我有點模糊
They were there at a time... I have a vaguely exact idea.

1521
01:38:05.885 --> 01:38:06.886
-多模糊？ -你們說什麼？
- How vague? - What are you talking about?

1522
01:38:07.053 --> 01:38:07.929
我們要去哪？
Where are we going?

1523
01:38:08.096 --> 01:38:09.014
我確定他們在那裡
I know for a fact they were there.

1524
01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.890
-誰啊？這幹嘛？ -我知道我怎麼知道的
Who's they? What are we doing? And I know how I know.

1525
01:38:13.268 --> 01:38:14.811
到底是怎樣？
Guys, what is it?

1526
01:38:15.395 --> 01:38:17.022
看來我們要隨機應變
Looks like we're improvising.

1527
01:38:17.188 --> 01:38:18.314
-太好了 -隨機應變什麼？
- Great. - What are we improvising?

1528
01:38:18.481 --> 01:38:20.233
史考特，把這拿回總部
Scott, get this back to the compound.

1529
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.317
整裝
Suit up.

1530
01:38:21.651 --> 01:38:23.111
-紐澤西有什麼？ -04
- What's in New Jersey? - 0-4.

1531
01:38:23.278 --> 01:38:24.112

1532
0-4.

1533
01:38:24.279 --> 01:38:25.280
-07
-07

1534
01:38:25.447 --> 01:38:27.323
-請問一下 -1970 - Uh, 0-7.
- 0-7. - Excuse me. - 1-9-7-0.

1535
01:38:27.782 --> 01:38:28.700
你確定嗎？
Are you sure?

1536
01:38:28.867 --> 01:38:30.160
隊長？
Cap? Captain?

1537
01:38:30.326 --> 01:38:32.162
史帝夫？抱歉
Steve? Sorry.

1538

美國…羅傑斯
America. Rogers.

1539
01:38:34.122 --> 01:38:35.331
如果這麼做
Look, if you do this...

1540
01:38:35.623 --> 01:38:38.168
卻沒用，你們就回不來了
and it doesn't work, you're not coming back.

1541
01:38:39.252 --> 01:38:41.046
謝謝你的鼓勵，小蟻子
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

1542
01:38:42.088 --> 01:38:43.298
你相信我嗎？
You trust me?

1543
01:38:44.174 --> 01:38:45.342
相信
I do.

1544
01:38:46.384 --> 01:38:47.719
你決定
Your call.

1545
01:38:48.595 --> 01:38:50.305
出發吧
Here we go.

1546
01:38:57.228 --> 01:38:59.814
（紐澤西，1970年）

1547
01:39:00.732 --> 01:39:03.193
（說夠了）

1548
01:39:06.363 --> 01:39:09.991
老兄！做愛不打仗
Hey, man! Make love, not war.

1549
01:39:10.158 --> 01:39:12.911
（美國陸軍勒海營基地）

1550
01:39:13.078 --> 01:39:15.747
（第78步兵師，美國隊長誕生地）

1551
01:39:15.914 --> 01:39:18.583
顯然你不是在這裡出生吧？
Clearly you weren't actually born here, right?

1552
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.251
我的概念是
The idea of me was.

1553
01:39:21.419 --> 01:39:22.962
假設你是神盾局
Right. Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1554
01:39:23.129 --> 01:39:26.383
運作一個類法西斯情報組織
running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization...

1555
01:39:27.717 --> 01:39:29.302
你會藏在哪裡？
where do you hide it?

1556
01:39:29.469 --> 01:39:31.137
近在眼前
In plain sight.

1557
01:39:59.541 --> 01:40:00.667
祝你任務順利，隊長
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1558
01:40:00.834 --> 01:40:03.378
祝你計畫順利，博士
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

1559
01:40:06.798 --> 01:40:07.882
新來的嗎？
You new here?

1560
01:40:10.427 --> 01:40:11.761
不算
Not exactly.

1561
01:40:18.435 --> 01:40:20.228
快啊，混蛋
Come on, you bastard.

1562
01:40:20.395 --> 01:40:23.148
（伽瑪特徵不符）

1563
01:40:25.442 --> 01:40:26.860
（目標相符）

1564
01:40:27.027 --> 01:40:28.528
找到了
Gotcha.

1565
01:40:34.033 --> 01:40:35.034
Whew.

1566
01:40:46.087 --> 01:40:47.756
重回戰場
Back in the game.

1567
01:40:50.425 --> 01:40:51.634
阿尼姆，你在裡面嗎？
Arnim, you in there?

1568
01:40:52.594 --> 01:40:53.636
阿尼姆？
Arnim?

1569
01:40:58.933 --> 01:41:00.268
喂！
Hey!

1570
01:41:00.935 --> 01:41:02.645
門在這邊，老兄
The door is this way, pal.

1571
01:41:03.646 --> 01:41:04.522
對喔
Oh, yeah.

1572
01:41:04.689 --> 01:41:06.566
我在找左拉博士，有看到他嗎？
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?

1573
01:41:06.733 --> 01:41:10.153
左拉博士…我沒看到任何人
Yeah, Doctor Zola. No, I haven't seen a soul.

1574
01:41:11.654 --> 01:41:12.989
不好意思
Pardon me.

1575
01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.367
我們認識嗎？
Do I know you?

1576
01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:17.619
不認識
No, sir. Uh...

1577
01:41:19.079 --> 01:41:20.872
我從麻省理工學院來訪
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1578
01:41:21.456 --> 01:41:22.582
麻省理工學院
Oh. MIT.

1579
01:41:23.041 --> 01:41:24.167
大名？
Got a name?

1580
01:41:24.626 --> 01:41:25.752
霍華
Howard.

1581
01:41:25.919 --> 01:41:28.421
-很好記 -霍華…
- That'll be easy to remember. - Howard...

1582
01:41:29.422 --> 01:41:30.423
波茲
Potts.

1583
01:41:31.007 --> 01:41:33.218
我是霍華史塔克
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1584
01:41:33.385 --> 01:41:34.302
你好
Hi.

1585
01:41:34.469 --> 01:41:35.762
握手，別拉手指
Shake that, don't pull it.

1586
01:41:35.929 --> 01:41:36.930
是
Yeah.

1587
01:41:38.348 --> 01:41:40.558
你看來氣色不太好，波茲
You look a little green around the gills, there, Potts.

1588
01:41:40.725 --> 01:41:42.894
我很好，只是上班累了
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1589
01:41:43.061 --> 01:41:44.771
想出去透透氣嗎？
You wanna get some air?

1590
01:41:47.315 --> 01:41:49.109
-喂，波茲 -是
- Hello, Potts. - Yeah.

1591
01:41:49.275 --> 01:41:50.527
-好啊 -這邊請
- That'd be swell. - That way.

1592
01:41:50.694 --> 01:41:51.653
好
Okay.

1593
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.488
需要拿公事包嗎？
Need your briefcase?

1594
01:41:57.826 --> 01:42:00.412
你不是披頭族吧，波茲？
You're not one of those beatniks, are you, Potts?

1595
01:42:06.251 --> 01:42:08.044
-喂？ -皮姆博士？
- Hello? - Doctor Pym?

1596
01:42:08.211 --> 01:42:10.422
你打的號碼沒錯，是
That would be the number that you called, yes.

1597
01:42:10.588 --> 01:42:12.841
我是快遞公司的史帝芬斯隊長
This is Captain Stevens from shipping.

1598
01:42:13.008 --> 01:42:14.134
有你的包裹
We have a package for you.

1599
01:42:14.509 --> 01:42:15.677
拿上來
Oh, bring it up.

1600
01:42:15.844 --> 01:42:17.804
問題就在這，沒辦法
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

1601
01:42:18.930 --> 01:42:21.558
我不懂，那不是你的工作嗎？
I'm confused. I thought that was your job.

1602
01:42:21.725 --> 01:42:23.101
因為…
Well, it's just...

1603
01:42:23.268 --> 01:42:24.728
先生，這箱子在發光
Sir, the box is glowing...

1604
01:42:24.894 --> 01:42:27.689
我們有些快遞員覺得不舒服
and to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great.

1605
01:42:27.856 --> 01:42:29.566
他們沒打開箱子吧？
They didn't open it, did they?

1606
01:42:29.733 --> 01:42:31.901
有，你最好下來
Uh, yeah, they did. You better get down here.

1607
01:42:32.736 --> 01:42:34.654
借過，讓開
Excuse me! Out of the way!

1608
01:42:39.367 --> 01:42:41.786
（亨利皮姆博士）

1609
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:55.633
（皮姆粒子，請勿碰觸）

1610
01:43:01.848 --> 01:43:05.352
鮮花和德國酸菜，晚上有重要約會嗎？
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?

1611
01:43:06.102 --> 01:43:07.562
我太太懷孕了
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1612
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:10.565
我花太多時間在辦公室
And too much time at the office.

1613
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.777
恭喜
Congratulations.

1614
01:43:13.943 --> 01:43:16.071
-謝謝，麻煩拿一下 -沒問題
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya? - Yeah, sure.

1615
01:43:17.155 --> 01:43:19.240
-她懷孕幾個月？ -不知道
- How far along is she? - Uh, I don't know.

1616
01:43:21.034 --> 01:43:23.787
目前她受不了我嚼東西的聲音
She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

1617
01:43:23.953 --> 01:43:27.415
我又得在廚房角落吃晚餐了
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.

1618
01:43:28.333 --> 01:43:29.334
我有個女兒
I have a little girl.

1619
01:43:29.501 --> 01:43:31.002
生女兒不錯
A girl would be nice.

1620
01:43:31.169 --> 01:43:33.171
比較不會變得跟我一個樣
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.

1621
01:43:33.838 --> 01:43:35.298
那有什麼不好？
What'd be so awful about that?

1622
01:43:35.465 --> 01:43:40.845
我認為我通常是個自私的人
Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

1623
01:43:44.891 --> 01:43:45.934
妳沒見過這兩個人？
And you've never seen these two men before?

1624
01:43:46.101 --> 01:43:47.936
我直覺很準，他們倆怪怪的
No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.

1625
01:43:48.103 --> 01:43:50.355
-長什麼樣子？ -一個留嬉皮鬍鬚
Can you describe them? One of them had a hippie beard.

1626
01:43:50.522 --> 01:43:52.691
嬉皮，像比吉斯還是蒙哥傑瑞？
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1627
01:43:52.857 --> 01:43:53.900
很像蒙哥傑瑞
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1628
01:43:54.067 --> 01:43:56.236
我是契斯勒，請所有憲兵到地下六樓
Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MP to sublevel six.

1629
01:43:56.403 --> 01:43:58.279
可能有外人闖入
We have a potential breach.

1630
01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.006
（瑪格麗特卡特，局長）

1631
01:44:16.172 --> 01:44:17.132
我說把他們轉過來
I said bring them in.

1632
01:44:17.298 --> 01:44:18.299
他們在想辦法，
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit

1633
01:44:18.466 --> 01:44:19.467
但布拉多克的小組因雷擊受阻
has been stopped by lightning strikes.

1634
01:44:19.634 --> 01:44:20.468
真是的
Oh, for the love of...

1635
01:44:20.635 --> 01:44:22.137
我來看看氣象預報
I'll look at the weather projections.

1636
01:44:46.161 --> 01:44:48.163
情況不是雷擊
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

1637
01:44:59.507 --> 01:45:01.217
你們想好名字了嗎？
So, where you at with names?

1638
01:45:01.384 --> 01:45:04.512
如果是男生，我太太喜歡艾蒙佐
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. Huh.

1639
01:45:05.472 --> 01:45:07.766
再考慮一下，還有時間
Might wanna let that stew awhile. You got time. - Uh-huh.

1640
01:45:09.559 --> 01:45:11.061
問你一個問題
Let me ask you a question.

1641
01:45:12.062 --> 01:45:15.315
小孩出生時，你緊張嗎？
When your kid was born, were you nervous?

1642
01:45:15.482 --> 01:45:16.816
快瘋了
Wildly.

1643
01:45:17.067 --> 01:45:18.777
-嗯 -你覺得自己夠格嗎？
- Yeah. - Did you feel qualified?

1644
01:45:18.943 --> 01:45:22.530
你知道如何當個成功的父親嗎？
Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?

1645
01:45:22.947 --> 01:45:25.784
我一路走來邊做邊學
I literally pieced it together as I went along.

1646
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:27.952
回想我爸的做法
I thought about what my dad did.

1647
01:45:28.661 --> 01:45:30.830
我老爸一律用皮帶解決問題
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

1648
01:45:31.623 --> 01:45:33.667
我以為我爸對我很嚴格
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1649
01:45:33.833 --> 01:45:36.544
如今回想起來，我只記得好的事情
And now, looking back on it, I just remember the good stuff.

1650
01:45:36.711 --> 01:45:38.296
他說過一些至理名言
You know? He did drop the odd pearl.

1651
01:45:38.463 --> 01:45:39.839
是嗎？譬如說？
Yeah? Like what?

1652
01:45:40.965 --> 01:45:43.468
金錢買不到時間
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time."

1653
01:45:44.803 --> 01:45:45.845
有智慧
Smart guy.

1654
01:45:46.262 --> 01:45:47.722
他盡力了
He did his best.

1655
01:45:49.099 --> 01:45:53.061
孩子還沒出生，我已願為他付出一切
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1656
01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:03.196
幸會，波茲
Good to meet you, Potts.

1657
01:46:03.863 --> 01:46:04.698
嗯
Yeah.

1658
01:46:05.115 --> 01:46:06.282
霍華
Howard...

1659
01:46:06.866 --> 01:46:08.451
一切都會很順利的
everything's gonna be all right.

1660
01:46:11.454 --> 01:46:12.706
謝謝你…
Thank you...

1661
01:46:13.665 --> 01:46:15.000
所做的一切…
for everything...

1662
01:46:15.417 --> 01:46:17.711
為我們國家效力
you've done for this country.

1663
01:46:20.588 --> 01:46:21.715
老賈
Jarvis.

1664
01:46:25.427 --> 01:46:26.970
我們見過那個人嗎？
Have we ever met that guy?

1665
01:46:28.972 --> 01:46:30.473
您見過很多人，先生
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1666
01:46:33.101 --> 01:46:34.728
看來非常面熟
Seems very familiar.

1667
01:46:35.645 --> 01:46:37.105
奇怪的鬍子
Weird beard.

1668
01:46:45.447 --> 01:46:46.448
妳真弱
You're weak.

1669
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:48.074
我是妳
I'm you.

1670
01:47:05.717 --> 01:47:07.802
妳可以阻止這件事
You could stop this.

1671
01:47:08.094 --> 01:47:09.888
妳知道妳想阻止它
You know you want to.

1672
01:47:10.597 --> 01:47:12.766
妳看到未來發生的情況了嗎？
Did you see what happens in the future?

1673
01:47:14.059 --> 01:47:16.436
薩諾斯找到靈魂寶石
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1674
01:47:17.979 --> 01:47:19.981
想知道他怎麼找到的嗎？
You wanna know how he does that?

1675
01:47:21.358 --> 01:47:25.528
想知道他怎麼對妳的嗎？
You wanna know what he does to you?

1676
01:47:26.029 --> 01:47:27.030
夠了
That's enough.

1677
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:41.294
妳令我覺得噁心
You disgust me.

1678
01:47:42.587 --> 01:47:47.467
但這不代表妳毫無用處
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1679
01:48:09.155 --> 01:48:10.865
我看起來如何？
How do I look?

1680
01:48:13.159 --> 01:48:15.704
（佛米爾星，2014年）

1681
01:48:17.455 --> 01:48:18.456
哇
Wow.

1682
01:48:19.457 --> 01:48:22.585
要是情況不同
Under different circumstances...

1683
01:48:22.752 --> 01:48:24.754
這會讓人十分驚豔
this would be totally awesome.

1684
01:48:36.891 --> 01:48:39.728
我敢說那隻浣熊不必爬山
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain.

1685
01:48:39.894 --> 01:48:41.813
嚴格說來他不是浣熊
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1686
01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:43.523
隨便，他都吃垃圾
Oh, whatever. He eats garbage.

1687
01:48:43.690 --> 01:48:45.025
歡迎
Welcome.

1688
01:48:48.194 --> 01:48:49.529
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1689
01:48:49.696 --> 01:48:50.697
伊凡之女
Daughter of Ivan.

1690
01:48:52.032 --> 01:48:53.158
克林特
Clint.

1691
01:48:53.324 --> 01:48:55.618
伊蒂絲之子
Son of Edith.

1692
01:49:00.999 --> 01:49:02.459
你是誰？
Who are you?

1693
01:49:03.084 --> 01:49:05.545
就把我當成嚮導…
Consider me a guide...

1694
01:49:05.712 --> 01:49:07.380
帶領你們…
to you...

1695
01:49:07.547 --> 01:49:09.382
以及所有尋找靈魂寶石的人
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1696
01:49:09.549 --> 01:49:10.592
很好
Oh, good.

1697
01:49:10.759 --> 01:49:12.886
說出它的下落，我們就啟程
You tell us where it is, then we'll be on our way.

1698
01:49:16.806 --> 01:49:19.059
有那麼簡單就好了
If only it were that easy.

1699
01:49:31.154 --> 01:49:34.866
你們尋找的就在你們眼前
What you seek lies in front of you.

1700
01:49:36.117 --> 01:49:38.536
你們所恐懼的也是
As does what you fear.

1701
01:49:43.458 --> 01:49:45.335
寶石在下面
The stone's down there.

1702
01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.879
你們其中一人能帶走
For one of you.

1703
01:49:48.171 --> 01:49:49.881
至於另一個…
For the other...

1704
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:54.469
若想拿到寶石
In order to take the stone...

1705
01:49:54.636 --> 01:49:57.639
就必須失去所愛
you must lose that which you love.

1706
01:49:59.015 --> 01:50:02.185
一項永恆的交易
An everlasting exchange.

1707
01:50:03.186 --> 01:50:07.273
以靈魂換取靈魂
A soul for a soul.

1708
01:50:09.859 --> 01:50:11.236
你好嗎？
How's it going?

1709
01:50:14.656 --> 01:50:16.074
天啊
Jesus.

1710
01:50:16.408 --> 01:50:18.118
也許他是瞎掰的
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1711
01:50:18.993 --> 01:50:20.328
不
No.

1712
01:50:21.162 --> 01:50:22.163
我覺得不是
I don't think so.

1713
01:50:22.872 --> 01:50:25.041
因為他知道妳爸的名字嗎？
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1714
01:50:26.668 --> 01:50:27.585
我不知道他的名字
I didn't.

1715
01:50:29.087 --> 01:50:31.464
薩諾斯帶走寶石
Thanos left here with the stone...

1716
01:50:32.132 --> 01:50:33.675
卻沒帶女兒走
without his daughter.

1717
01:50:33.842 --> 01:50:35.927
那不是巧合
That's not a coincidence.

1718
01:50:37.012 --> 01:50:38.638
是啊
Yeah.

1719
01:50:40.348 --> 01:50:42.225
不計代價
Whatever it takes.

1720
01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:48.231
不計代價
Whatever it takes.

1721
01:50:52.610 --> 01:50:54.571
如果不拿到那顆寶石
If we don't get that stone...

1722
01:50:54.738 --> 01:50:56.406
數十億人無法起死回生
billions of people stay dead.

1723
01:50:57.282 --> 01:50:58.450
是啊
Yeah.

1724
01:51:00.326 --> 01:51:02.454
我想我們都知道應該是誰
Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

1725
01:51:03.204 --> 01:51:04.372
沒錯
I guess we do.

1726
01:51:12.797 --> 01:51:17.510
我開始覺得我們指的是不同人，娜塔莎
I'm starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha.

1727
01:51:18.011 --> 01:51:19.846
五年來，我一直想做一件事
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing.

1728
01:51:20.013 --> 01:51:21.264
來到這裡
Get to right here.

1729
01:51:21.431 --> 01:51:23.433
達成目標，將所有人救回來
That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.

1730
01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.810
不准擺出正義女俠的樣子
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1731
01:51:25.977 --> 01:51:27.979
你以為我想做嗎？
What, you think I wanna do it?

1732
01:51:28.563 --> 01:51:30.315
我是想救你，白癡
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1733
01:51:30.482 --> 01:51:32.817
我不要妳去，如何？
Yeah, well, I don't want you to. How's that?

1734
01:51:33.735 --> 01:51:35.945
娜塔莎，妳知道我做過什麼
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1735
01:51:37.614 --> 01:51:39.407
妳知道我背負的罪
You know what I've become.

1736
01:51:41.534 --> 01:51:44.120
我不憑別人的大錯來評斷他們
Oh, I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.

1737
01:51:48.291 --> 01:51:49.542
或許妳應該
Maybe you should.

1738
01:51:50.418 --> 01:51:51.961
你就沒有
You didn't.

1739
01:51:58.134 --> 01:52:00.345
妳讓我很傷腦筋，知道嗎？
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1740
01:52:11.439 --> 01:52:12.649
好吧
Okay.

1741
01:52:14.401 --> 01:52:15.902
妳贏了
You win.

1742
01:52:22.367 --> 01:52:23.535
告訴我家人我愛他們
Tell my family I love 'em.

1743
01:52:27.247 --> 01:52:28.456
你自己告訴他們
You tell 'em yourself.

1744
01:53:01.322 --> 01:53:02.323
可惡
Damn you.

1745
01:53:09.831 --> 01:53:10.832
等等
Wait.

1746
01:53:18.882 --> 01:53:20.717
放開我
Let me go.

1747
01:53:21.968 --> 01:53:22.969
不
No.

1748
01:53:24.721 --> 01:53:25.722
不，求求妳
No. Please, no.

1749
01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:30.935
沒關係
It's okay.

1750
01:53:33.146 --> 01:53:33.980
求求妳
Please.

1751
01:53:36.066 --> 01:53:37.067
不！
No!

1752
01:55:18.543 --> 01:55:19.544
全都拿到了嗎？
Did we get 'em all?

1753
01:55:20.962 --> 01:55:22.756
你是說真的成功了？
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1754
01:55:27.594 --> 01:55:28.803
克林特，小娜呢？
Clint, where's Nat?

1755
01:55:58.041 --> 01:55:59.042
她有家人嗎？
Do we know if she had family?

1756
01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:01.378
有
Yeah.

1757
01:56:01.544 --> 01:56:02.545
我們
Us.

1758
01:56:03.963 --> 01:56:05.006
怎麼了？
What?

1759
01:56:06.966 --> 01:56:08.134
-你在幹嘛？ -問他問題
Huh? - What are you doing? - Just asked him a question.

1760
01:56:08.301 --> 01:56:09.552
你一副她死了的樣子
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1761
01:56:09.719 --> 01:56:12.180
何必如喪考妣？我們有寶石啊
Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right?

1762
01:56:12.347 --> 01:56:13.348
只要我們有寶石…
As long as we have the stones...

1763
01:56:13.515 --> 01:56:15.266
就能救她回來，不是嗎？
Cap, we can bring her back. Isn't that right?

1764
01:56:15.433 --> 01:56:17.435
別這樣，我們是復仇者聯盟，振作
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together.

1765
01:56:17.602 --> 01:56:18.812
我們不能救她回來
Can't get her back.

1766
01:56:21.815 --> 01:56:23.066
什麼？
What's he...? What?

1767
01:56:23.233 --> 01:56:24.442
那無法逆轉
It can't be undone.

1768
01:56:25.026 --> 01:56:26.736
沒辦法
It can't.

1769
01:56:29.239 --> 01:56:32.367
抱歉，恕我直說，你是凡人
Look, I'm sorry, no offence, but you're a very earthly being, okay?

1770
01:56:32.534 --> 01:56:33.827
我們說的是太空魔法
And we're talking about space magic.

1771
01:56:33.993 --> 01:56:35.995
講"無法"好像太鐵齒了
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think?

1772
01:56:36.162 --> 01:56:38.998
我知道我層次不夠高
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my pay grade here.

1773
01:56:39.165 --> 01:56:40.625
但她還是不在這裡
But she still isn't here, is she?

1774
01:56:40.792 --> 01:56:41.793
這就是我要講的
No, that's my point.

1775
01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:44.921
它無法逆轉
It can't be undone.

1776
01:56:45.088 --> 01:56:48.425
至少那個紅色漂浮人是這麼說的
Or that's at least what the red, floating guy had to say.

1777
01:56:48.591 --> 01:56:50.051
你可以去找他談
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1778
01:56:50.218 --> 01:56:53.263
拿你的鎚子飛去找他談
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him.

1779
01:57:01.813 --> 01:57:03.857
原本應該是我
It was supposed to be me.

1780
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:08.403
她為那顆寶石犧牲生命
She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.

1781
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:10.030
她賭上自己的命
She bet her life on it.

1782
01:57:14.951 --> 01:57:17.287
她不會回來了
She's not coming back.

1783
01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.623
我們得讓她犧牲得有價值
We have to make it worth it.

1784
01:57:21.124 --> 01:57:22.584
重如泰山
We have to.

1785
01:57:24.002 --> 01:57:25.670
我們會的
We will.

1786
01:57:50.362 --> 01:57:51.488
砰！
Boom!

1787
01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.620
手套準備好了
All right, the glove's ready.

1788
01:57:59.412 --> 01:58:01.998
問題是誰來彈指？
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1789
01:58:02.165 --> 01:58:04.250
-我來 -什麼？
- I'll do it. - Excuse me?

1790
01:58:04.417 --> 01:58:05.377
沒關係
It's okay.

1791
01:58:05.543 --> 01:58:06.461
別急
Stop, stop. Slow down.

1792
01:58:06.628 --> 01:58:08.129
索爾，等一下
Thor. Just wait.

1793
01:58:08.296 --> 01:58:10.131
我們還沒決定誰戴手套
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.

1794
01:58:10.507 --> 01:58:13.426
抱歉，我們還要坐等適當時機嗎？
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?

1795
01:58:13.593 --> 01:58:14.719
至少應該討論一下
We should at least discuss it.

1796
01:58:14.886 --> 01:58:18.723
盯著那東西看不能救所有人回來
Look, sitting here staring at the thing is not gonna bring everybody back.

1797
01:58:19.766 --> 01:58:22.686
我是最強的復仇者，就該擔起責任
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1798
01:58:22.852 --> 01:58:24.062
-平常是那樣沒錯 -我的責任
- Normally, you're right. - It's my duty.

1799
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:26.022
-重點不在那 -不是那樣
- It's not about that. - It's not that.

1800
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:27.982
-兄弟 -閉嘴！讓我來
- Hey, buddy... - Stop it! Just let me.

1801
01:58:30.985 --> 01:58:32.487
讓我來
Just let me do it.

1802
01:58:32.654 --> 01:58:35.156
讓我做件好事，對的事
Just let me do something good. Something right.

1803
01:58:35.323 --> 01:58:36.324
這手套發出的能量
Look, it's not just the fact...

1804
01:58:36.491 --> 01:58:38.618
不僅足以供電給整座大陸
that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent.

1805
01:58:38.785 --> 01:58:40.787
你的狀況也不理想
I'm telling you. You're in no condition.

1806
01:58:40.954 --> 01:58:43.998
你想我血管裡現在流著什麼？
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?

1807
01:58:44.165 --> 01:58:45.208
起司醬？
Cheez Whiz?

1808
01:58:47.752 --> 01:58:48.753
閃電
Lightning.

1809
01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.046
-對 -閃電
Yeah. Lightning.

1810
01:58:50.213 --> 01:58:51.589
閃電幫不了你，兄弟
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1811
01:58:51.756 --> 01:58:53.591
應該是我
It's gotta be me.

1812
01:58:54.926 --> 01:58:57.095
你們看到哪些寶石對薩諾斯的影響
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1813
01:58:57.262 --> 01:58:58.805
它們差點殺死他
They almost killed him.

1814
01:59:00.223 --> 01:59:02.100
你們都無法存活
None of you could survive.

1815
01:59:02.809 --> 01:59:04.436
我們怎麼知道你可以？
How do we know you will?

1816
01:59:04.602 --> 01:59:05.645
不知道
We don't.

1817
01:59:05.937 --> 01:59:08.481
但那輻射主要是伽瑪
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1818
01:59:11.985 --> 01:59:13.570
看來…
It's like...

1819
01:59:15.447 --> 01:59:17.365
我就是最佳人選
I was made for this.

1820
01:59:36.301 --> 01:59:37.802
可以了嗎？
Good to go, yeah?

1821
01:59:39.929 --> 01:59:40.930
動手吧
Let's do it.

1822
01:59:41.097 --> 01:59:44.142
記住，薩諾斯五年前殺害的所有人
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago...

1823
01:59:44.309 --> 01:59:46.770
你只能將他們帶回到今天
you're just bringing them back to now, today.

1824
01:59:46.936 --> 01:59:48.355
別改變過去五年的任何事
Don't change anything from the last five years.

1825
01:59:49.773 --> 01:59:50.940
瞭解
Got it.

1826
02:00:07.332 --> 02:00:10.126
星期五，幫我啟動穀倉門協定
Friday, do me a favour and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1827
02:00:10.293 --> 02:00:11.586
是，老闆
Yes, boss.

1828
02:00:20.178 --> 02:00:22.013
大家回來吧
Everybody comes home.

1829
02:00:45.412 --> 02:00:46.830
脫掉…
Take it off! Take it off!

1830
02:00:46.996 --> 02:00:48.123
等等，布魯斯，你還好嗎？
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1831
02:00:49.290 --> 02:00:50.500
說話，班納
Talk to me, Banner.

1832
02:00:53.670 --> 02:00:54.671
我沒事
I'm okay.

1833
02:00:55.171 --> 02:00:56.464
我沒事
I'm okay.

1834
02:01:01.261 --> 02:01:02.303
（入口開啟，原點2014年）

1835
02:01:27.912 --> 02:01:29.039
布魯斯
Bruce!

1836
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:32.375
別動他
Don't move him.

1837
02:01:39.257 --> 02:01:41.259
-成功了嗎？ -不確定，沒關係
- Did it work? - We're not sure. It's okay.

1838
02:02:15.585 --> 02:02:19.839
（蘿拉）

1839
02:02:27.764 --> 02:02:28.640
親愛的

1840
02:02:28.807 --> 02:02:29.766
克林特？
Honey. Clint?

1841
02:02:29.933 --> 02:02:31.184
親愛的
Honey.

1842
02:02:32.018 --> 02:02:33.353
大夥
Guys...

1843
02:02:35.814 --> 02:02:37.190
我想成功了
I think it worked.

1844
02:03:19.816 --> 02:03:21.693
我不能呼吸…
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

1845
02:03:22.944 --> 02:03:24.738
頭罩…
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1846
02:03:31.369 --> 02:03:33.163
羅德、火箭，快離開
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

1847
02:03:34.330 --> 02:03:35.874
讓我上去…
Let me up! Let me up!

1848
02:03:36.624 --> 02:03:37.375
快啊！
Come on!

1849
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:48.345
羅德
Rhodey!

1850
02:03:50.605 --> 02:03:51.905
Huh?

1851
02:03:56.895 --> 02:03:59.939
求救…有人收到嗎？我們在下層，淹水了
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy? We're on the lower level. It's flooding!

1852
02:04:00.106 --> 02:04:01.816
什麼？
What? What?

1853
02:04:01.983 --> 02:04:04.152
我們溺水了，有人收到嗎？求救
We are drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1854
02:04:04.319 --> 02:04:06.488
等等，我在
Wait! I'm here!

1855
02:04:06.654 --> 02:04:08.156
我在，聽到了嗎？
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1856
02:04:27.801 --> 02:04:29.010
隊長？
Cap?

1857
02:04:52.992 --> 02:04:54.119
好
Okay.

1858
02:05:13.388 --> 02:05:14.514
女兒
Daughter.

1859
02:05:14.681 --> 02:05:15.849
是，父親
Yes, Father.

1860
02:05:17.726 --> 02:05:19.436
所以這就是未來
So, this is the future.

1861
02:05:20.103 --> 02:05:20.937
幹得好
Well done.

1862
02:05:21.855 --> 02:05:23.356
謝謝父親
Thank you, Father.

1863
02:05:23.523 --> 02:05:24.899
他們完全沒起疑
They suspected nothing.

1864
02:05:27.235 --> 02:05:28.695
傲慢者從不起疑
The arrogant never do.

1865
02:05:31.656 --> 02:05:32.782
去吧
Go.

1866
02:05:33.742 --> 02:05:36.161
去找寶石，拿來給我
Find the stones, bring them to me.

1867
02:05:36.327 --> 02:05:38.038
你會怎麼做？
What will you do?

1868
02:05:39.372 --> 02:05:41.041
等待
Wait.

1869
02:06:06.274 --> 02:06:07.942
告訴我一件事
Tell me something.

1870
02:06:09.069 --> 02:06:11.488
在未來…
In the future...

1871
02:06:11.654 --> 02:06:13.531
妳和我會怎麼樣？
what happens to you and me?

1872
02:06:15.825 --> 02:06:17.452
我企圖殺妳
I try to kill you.

1873
02:06:19.162 --> 02:06:20.663
好幾次
Several times.

1874
02:06:21.748 --> 02:06:23.708
但最後…
But eventually...

1875
02:06:23.875 --> 02:06:25.835
我們成為朋友
we become friends.

1876
02:06:27.337 --> 02:06:29.047
成為姊妹
We become sisters.

1877
02:06:36.721 --> 02:06:37.931
走吧
Come on.

1878
02:06:39.974 --> 02:06:41.768
我們能阻止他
We can stop him.

1879
02:06:49.859 --> 02:06:51.194
快醒醒
Come on, buddy, wake up!

1880
02:06:51.736 --> 02:06:53.196
這才對
That's my man.

1881
02:06:54.114 --> 02:06:56.157
你又弄丟了這個，我留著
You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

1882
02:06:59.703 --> 02:07:00.870
怎麼回事？
What happened?

1883
02:07:01.037 --> 02:07:03.164
改變時間往往會造成問題
You mess with time, it tends to mess back.

1884
02:07:03.331 --> 02:07:04.207
等會就知道
You'll see.

1885
02:07:26.312 --> 02:07:27.689
他在做什麼？
What's he been doing?

1886
02:07:29.607 --> 02:07:31.026
什麼都沒做
Absolutely nothing.

1887
02:07:32.777 --> 02:07:34.654
無限寶石呢？
Where are the stones?

1888
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:36.865
在這片瓦礫堆底下
Somewhere under all this.

1889
02:07:38.241 --> 02:07:40.452
我只知道不在他手中
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

1890
02:07:40.618 --> 02:07:42.370
那就保持下去
So, we keep it that way.

1891
02:07:42.537 --> 02:07:43.913
你們知道這是陷阱吧？
You know it's a trap, right?

1892
02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:45.415
是啊
Yeah.

1893
02:07:45.582 --> 02:07:46.916
管不了那麼多
I don't much care.

1894
02:07:47.667 --> 02:07:48.668
很好
Good.

1895
02:07:49.627 --> 02:07:52.130
只要我們有共識就好
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

1896
02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:03.892
這次讓他死得痛快
Let's kill him properly this time.

1897
02:08:13.276 --> 02:08:16.196
你們無法受失敗
You could not live with your own failure.

1898
02:08:17.697 --> 02:08:19.532
結果是什麼？
Where did that bring you?

1899
02:08:22.494 --> 02:08:24.371
再和我決一死戰
Back to me.

1900
02:08:27.791 --> 02:08:30.627
我以為殲滅半數生命
I thought by eliminating half of life...

1901
02:08:31.378 --> 02:08:33.755
另一半會成長茁壯
the other half would thrive.

1902
02:08:33.922 --> 02:08:35.256
但你們讓我看到…
But you've shown me...

1903
02:08:36.424 --> 02:08:38.176
那是不可能的
that's impossible.

1904
02:08:40.095 --> 02:08:43.390
只要有人記得昔日的榮景
And as long as there are those that remember what was...

1905
02:08:43.556 --> 02:08:48.770
就必定有人無法接受現實
there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be.

1906
02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:50.772
他們會反抗
They will resist.

1907
02:08:51.272 --> 02:08:53.191
對，我們就是那麼頑強
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

1908
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:55.694
我很感恩
I'm thankful.

1909
02:08:57.862 --> 02:08:59.614
因為現在…
Because now...

1910
02:08:59.781 --> 02:09:01.908
我知道自己該怎麼做
I know what I must do.

1911
02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:05.328
我將瓦解這宇宙
I will shred this universe...

1912
02:09:05.495 --> 02:09:07.539
消滅到最後一個原子不剩
down to its last atom.

1913
02:09:08.331 --> 02:09:10.000
然後
And then...

1914
02:09:10.166 --> 02:09:12.502
靠你們幫我蒐集來的寶石
with the stones you've collected for me...

1915
02:09:13.294 --> 02:09:15.422
創造一個新宇宙
create a new one...

1916
02:09:15.588 --> 02:09:17.799
充滿生命
teeming with life...

1917
02:09:17.966 --> 02:09:19.843
它知道的不是失去什麼
that knows not what it has lost...

1918
02:09:20.010 --> 02:09:22.387
而是獲得什麼
but only what it has been given.

1919
02:09:25.473 --> 02:09:26.891
一個懂得感恩的宇宙
A grateful universe.

1920
02:09:27.434 --> 02:09:28.852
從鮮血中誕生
Born out of blood.

1921
02:09:29.019 --> 02:09:30.687
他們永遠不會知道
They'll never know it.

1922
02:09:31.896 --> 02:09:34.816
因為你們不會活著告訴他們
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

1923
02:09:49.414 --> 02:09:50.707
另一個世界見了
See you on the other side, man.

1924
02:09:53.043 --> 02:09:55.045
等等，我來了
Hang on! I'm coming!

1925
02:10:25.325 --> 02:10:26.326
耶！
Yeah!

1926
02:10:41.216 --> 02:10:42.759
嗨
Oh, hey.

1927
02:10:42.926 --> 02:10:44.636
我認識妳
I know you.

1928
02:10:47.555 --> 02:10:48.556
父親
Father...

1929
02:10:49.307 --> 02:10:50.725
寶石到手了
I have the stones.

1930
02:10:50.892 --> 02:10:51.810
什麼？
What?

1931
02:10:53.186 --> 02:10:54.104
住手
Stop.

1932
02:10:59.317 --> 02:11:00.735
妳背叛我們？
You're betraying us?

1933
02:11:06.741 --> 02:11:08.034
妳不必這麼做
You don't have to do this.

1934
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:13.373
這是我的天命
I am this.

1935
02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:15.458
不，並不是
No, you're not.

1936
02:11:15.917 --> 02:11:17.794
妳見過我們未來的下場
You've seen what we become.

1937
02:11:23.883 --> 02:11:26.094
涅布拉，聽她的話
Nebula, listen to her.

1938
02:11:27.554 --> 02:11:28.430
妳能改變
You can change.

1939
02:11:35.103 --> 02:11:36.604
他不會讓我改變的
He won't let me.

1940
02:11:38.231 --> 02:11:38.982
不！
No!

1941
02:11:58.626 --> 02:12:00.003
索爾，打我
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1942
02:12:16.644 --> 02:12:17.937
老闆，醒醒！
Boss, wake up!

1943
02:13:09.239 --> 02:13:10.532
我就知道
I knew it!

1944
02:14:32.906 --> 02:14:35.742
我多年來的征戰
In all my years of conquest...

1945
02:14:37.035 --> 02:14:38.787
暴力
violence...

1946
02:14:39.829 --> 02:14:41.790
屠殺
slaughter...

1947
02:14:42.916 --> 02:14:45.335
向來不為一己之私
it was never personal.

1948
02:14:47.921 --> 02:14:50.006
但我現在告訴你
But I'll tell you now...

1949
02:14:52.008 --> 02:14:58.264
當對付你那頑固惱人的小星球時
what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet...

1950
02:15:00.016 --> 02:15:02.227
我會非常非常…
I'm gonna enjoy it...

1951
02:15:03.144 --> 02:15:05.730
樂在其中
very, very much.

1952
02:16:09.002 --> 02:16:10.545
隊長，聽到了嗎？
Hey, Cap, you read me?

1953
02:16:16.551 --> 02:16:18.845
隊長，我山姆，聽到了嗎？
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

1954
02:16:22.849 --> 02:16:24.267
在你左邊
On your left.

1955
02:17:49.936 --> 02:17:51.229
大家都到了嗎？
Is that everyone?

1956
02:17:51.396 --> 02:17:53.606
你還嫌不夠嗎？
What? You wanted more?

1957
02:18:20.133 --> 02:18:22.093
復仇者聯盟…
Avengers...

1958
02:18:27.223 --> 02:18:28.308
集結
assemble.

1959
02:19:03.510 --> 02:19:04.761
去死吧！
Die!

1960
02:19:25.407 --> 02:19:28.159
不，給我，你拿小的
No, no, give me that. You have the little one.

1961
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:42.674
喂！
Hey!

1962
02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:44.676
哇靠
Holy cow!

1963
02:19:44.843 --> 02:19:46.219
你不會相信發生了什麼事
You will not believe what's been going on.

1964
02:19:46.302 --> 02:19:47.512
記得我們在太空中嗎？
Do you remember when we were in space?

1965
02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:49.055
我變成灰燼？
And I got all dusty?

1966
02:19:49.222 --> 02:19:51.891
我一定昏倒了，醒來後你就不見了
And I must've passed out, because I woke up and you were gone.

1967
02:19:52.058 --> 02:19:53.685
奇異博士在那邊，他說…
But Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like...

1968
02:19:53.852 --> 02:19:55.353
"五年了，快，他們需要我們"
"It's been five years. Come on, they need us."

1969
02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:57.188
然後開始像平常那樣畫火圈
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time.

1970
02:19:57.355 --> 02:19:58.189
是嗎？不
He did? Oh, no.

1971
02:19:58.356 --> 02:19:59.649
你幹嘛？
What are you doing? - Oh.

1972
02:20:04.696 --> 02:20:06.197
感覺好溫馨
Oh, this is nice.

1973
02:20:27.969 --> 02:20:28.970
葛摩菈？
Gamora?

1974
02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:40.065
我以為我失去妳了
I thought I lost you.

1975
02:20:44.652 --> 02:20:47.572
不要…碰…我
Ow. Don't touch me!

1976
02:20:50.575 --> 02:20:52.410
妳第一次沒踢中
You missed the first time.

1977
02:20:52.577 --> 02:20:54.579
第二次兩顆都中
Then you got 'em both the second time.

1978
02:20:56.581 --> 02:20:57.665
就是這個？
This is the one?

1979
02:20:57.832 --> 02:20:58.833
真假？
Seriously?

1980
02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.002
妳只能挑他或一棵樹
Your choices were him or a tree.

1981
02:21:11.805 --> 02:21:12.806
隊長
Cap!

1982
02:21:12.972 --> 02:21:14.724
你要我拿這玩意做什麼？
What do you want me to do with this damn thing?

1983
02:21:17.435 --> 02:21:19.479
把寶石拿得越遠越好
Get those stones as far away as possible!

1984
02:21:19.646 --> 02:21:20.689
不！
No!

1985
02:21:21.856 --> 02:21:23.817
我們得將它們送回原處
We need to get 'em back where they came from.

1986
02:21:23.983 --> 02:21:26.569
沒辦法，薩諾斯摧毀了量子隧道
No way to get 'em back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1987
02:21:26.736 --> 02:21:27.570
等一下
Hold on!

1988
02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:31.574
那不是我們唯一的時間機器
That wasn't our only time machine.

1989
02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:39.499
有人看到很醜的棕色廂型車嗎？
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

1990
02:21:40.041 --> 02:21:43.128
有！你不會喜歡它停的地方
Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!

1991
02:21:43.294 --> 02:21:45.422
史考特，讓那玩意發揮作用要多久？
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

1992
02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:47.799
大約十分鐘
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

1993
02:21:47.966 --> 02:21:49.467
開始發動，我們拿寶石給你
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

1994
02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:51.177
馬上辦，隊長
We're on it, Cap.

1995
02:22:00.937 --> 02:22:02.063
嘿
Hey.

1996
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:05.233
你說我們勝率一千四百萬分之一？
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?

1997
02:22:06.151 --> 02:22:07.152
告訴我就是這次
Tell me this is it.

1998
02:22:07.569 --> 02:22:09.446
如果我告訴你會發生什麼事
If I tell you what happens...

1999
02:22:09.612 --> 02:22:10.780
它就不會發生
it won't happen.

2000
02:22:14.367 --> 02:22:15.368
你最好是對的
You better be right.

2001
02:22:23.793 --> 02:22:25.170
這裡好混亂
It's a mess back here.

2002
02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:27.172
車子掛了
It's dead.

2003
02:22:28.465 --> 02:22:29.966
-什麼？ -拋錨
- What? - It's dead.

2004
02:22:30.133 --> 02:22:31.551
我得接電熱線發動
I have to hot-wire it.

2005
02:22:34.637 --> 02:22:35.847
涅布拉呢？
Where's Nebula?

2006
02:22:36.973 --> 02:22:38.308
她沒回應
She's not responding.

2007
02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:40.018
老大
Sire...

2008
02:22:49.778 --> 02:22:51.029
克林特
Clint!

2009
02:22:53.073 --> 02:22:54.199
交給我
Give it to me.

2010
02:23:16.471 --> 02:23:19.849
你奪走了我的一切
You took everything from me.

2011
02:23:20.225 --> 02:23:22.560
我根本不知道妳是哪根蔥
I don't even know who you are.

2012
02:23:22.727 --> 02:23:24.354
你會知道的
You will.

2013
02:23:46.793 --> 02:23:47.752
交給我
I got it!

2014
02:23:50.296 --> 02:23:51.381
啟動速殺模式
Activate Instant Kill.

2015
02:24:14.821 --> 02:24:16.156
空中掃射！
Rain fire!

2016
02:24:16.865 --> 02:24:18.783
但老大，我們的部隊
But, sire, our troops!

2017
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:20.702
快點！
Just do it!

2018
02:24:40.847 --> 02:24:43.224
有人看到這個嗎？
Uh, is anyone else seeing this?

2019
02:24:57.155 --> 02:24:58.281
讓我來
I got this!

2020
02:24:58.531 --> 02:25:00.325
我來…我不行
I got this. Okay, I don't got this.

2021
02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:01.826
救命啊，快救命啊
Help, somebody help!

2022
02:25:01.993 --> 02:25:03.870
皇后區小子，注意
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2023
02:25:13.922 --> 02:25:14.964
等一下，我來救你
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2024
02:25:18.593 --> 02:25:19.761
很高興認識妳
Hey! Nice to meet you...

2025
02:25:19.928 --> 02:25:21.763
歐買尬！
Oh, my God!

2026
02:25:58.008 --> 02:25:59.467
這是甚麼啊？
What the hell is this?

2027
02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:01.344
星期五，他們在射什麼？
Friday, what are they firing at?

2028
02:26:01.511 --> 02:26:03.388
有東西進入高層大氣
Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

2029
02:26:16.651 --> 02:26:18.820
帥啦！
Oh, yeah!

2030
02:26:38.715 --> 02:26:41.134
丹佛斯，這裡需要協助
Danvers, we need an assist here.

2031
02:26:49.893 --> 02:26:52.479
妳好，我是彼得帕克
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

2032
02:26:53.104 --> 02:26:54.522
嗨，彼得帕克
Hey, Peter Parker.

2033
02:26:54.689 --> 02:26:55.857
有東西要給我嗎？
You got something for me?

2034
02:27:01.988 --> 02:27:04.074
我不知道妳要如何對付他們
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that.

2035
02:27:05.742 --> 02:27:07.160
別擔心
Don't worry.

2036
02:27:08.036 --> 02:27:09.621
她有幫手
She's got help.

2037
02:29:57.455 --> 02:30:00.959
我是無可匹敵的
I am inevitable.

2038
02:30:21.062 --> 02:30:22.605
我…
And I...

2039
02:30:24.274 --> 02:30:25.442
是…
am...

2040
02:30:29.154 --> 02:30:30.655
鋼鐵人
Iron Man.

2041
02:32:29.357 --> 02:32:31.067
史塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

2042
02:32:31.484 --> 02:32:32.736
嘿
Hey!

2043
02:32:33.737 --> 02:32:36.698
史塔克先生，聽得見嗎？
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

2044
02:32:36.865 --> 02:32:38.408
我是彼得
It's Peter.

2045
02:32:39.701 --> 02:32:41.327
嗨
Hey.

2046
02:32:42.370 --> 02:32:45.415
我們贏了，史塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2047
02:32:47.250 --> 02:32:49.419
我們贏了，史塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2048
02:32:51.046 --> 02:32:53.882
我們贏了，你成功了…
We won! You did it, sir, you did it.

2049
02:32:54.799 --> 02:32:56.092
對不起
I'm sorry.

2050
02:32:56.259 --> 02:32:57.260
東尼
Tony.

2051
02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:11.983
嗨
Hey.

2052
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:13.985
小辣椒
Hey, Pep.

2053
02:33:18.281 --> 02:33:19.366
星期五？
Friday?

2054
02:33:19.532 --> 02:33:22.285
生命功能危急
Life functions critical.

2055
02:33:30.877 --> 02:33:31.878
東尼
Tony?

2056
02:33:33.129 --> 02:33:34.214
看著我
Look at me.

2057
02:33:36.883 --> 02:33:38.802
我們會好好的
We're gonna be okay.

2058
02:33:43.515 --> 02:33:45.392
你可以休息了
You can rest now.

2059
02:35:30.914 --> 02:35:33.708
大家都要快樂結局，對吧？
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

2060
02:35:33.875 --> 02:35:36.086
但不見得總能如願
But it doesn't always roll that way.

2061
02:35:38.171 --> 02:35:39.839
或許這次可以
Maybe this time.

2062
02:35:41.424 --> 02:35:44.094
我希望如果妳播放這影片
I'm hoping if you play this back...

2063
02:35:45.762 --> 02:35:47.097
是為了慶祝
it's in celebration.

2064
02:35:48.348 --> 02:35:52.018
我希望家人團聚，我們恢復生機
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.

2065
02:35:52.185 --> 02:35:56.106
地球已經回復正常了
And something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.

2066
02:35:56.272 --> 02:35:58.233
如果真有所謂正常的地球
If there ever was such a thing.

2067
02:35:58.817 --> 02:36:01.820
天啊，我們的世界已是整個宇宙了
God, what a world. Universe, now.

2068
02:36:02.779 --> 02:36:04.781
如果十年前妳說人類並不孤單
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone...

2069
02:36:04.948 --> 02:36:08.618
更別說到這程度，我並不會驚訝
let alone to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised...

2070
02:36:08.785 --> 02:36:10.412
但拜託，誰曉得是這樣？
but come on, who knew?

2071
02:36:10.578 --> 02:36:15.208
光明與黑暗的驚人力量已發揮作用
The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play.

2072
02:36:15.375 --> 02:36:17.085
無論如何
And for better or worse...

2073
02:36:17.252 --> 02:36:21.423
那是摩根在成長時必須面對的現實
that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in.

2074
02:36:24.676 --> 02:36:26.469
所以我想最好錄一小段祝福
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting...

2075
02:36:26.636 --> 02:36:30.265
以防萬一我提早掛掉
in the case of an untimely death. On my part.

2076
02:36:30.432 --> 02:36:33.685
雖然任何時候掛掉都不是好時機
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

2077
02:36:34.894 --> 02:36:37.939
我們明天想嘗試的時間旅行
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow...

2078
02:36:38.106 --> 02:36:40.316
能否存活下來仍在未定之天
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all.

2079
02:36:40.483 --> 02:36:41.943
就是這事
That's the thing.

2080
02:36:43.903 --> 02:36:45.822
話說回來，這是超級英雄的職責
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

2081
02:36:45.989 --> 02:36:47.073
終點是旅程的一部分
Part of the journey is the end.

2082
02:36:49.075 --> 02:36:50.076
我何必緊張？
What am I even tripping for?

2083
02:36:50.243 --> 02:36:54.330
一切都會照計畫進行
Everything is gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to.

2084
02:36:57.834 --> 02:36:59.502
我愛妳三千次
I love you 3,000.

2085
02:37:19.606 --> 02:37:24.611
（東尼史塔克有心臟的證據）

2086
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:18.183
真希望我有辦法讓她知道
You know, I wish there was a way that I could let her know.

2087
02:39:20.685 --> 02:39:22.812
我們贏了
That we won.

2088
02:39:24.189 --> 02:39:25.899
我們成功了
We did it.

2089
02:39:29.486 --> 02:39:31.279
她知道
She knows.

2090
02:39:36.159 --> 02:39:38.244
他們倆都知道
They both do.

2091
02:39:47.212 --> 02:39:48.296
妳還好嗎，小可愛？
How you doing, squirt?

2092
02:39:48.463 --> 02:39:49.464
很好
Good.

2093
02:39:49.631 --> 02:39:50.965
-很好？ -嗯
- You good? - Mm-hmm.

2094
02:39:51.132 --> 02:39:53.843
-肚子餓嗎？ -嗯
- Good. You hungry? - Mm-hmm.

2095
02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:55.261
想吃什麼？
What do you want?

2096
02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:57.389
起司漢堡
Cheeseburgers.

2097
02:40:02.185 --> 02:40:04.437
妳爸也愛吃起司漢堡
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2098
02:40:04.604 --> 02:40:06.022
喔
Okay.

2099
02:40:08.608 --> 02:40:10.860
想吃多少起司漢堡我都買給妳
I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.

2100
02:40:11.027 --> 02:40:12.028
好
Okay.

2101
02:40:28.795 --> 02:40:30.213
那麼…
So...

2102
02:40:30.463 --> 02:40:32.632
你何時要回來？
when can we expect you back?

2103
02:40:34.718 --> 02:40:36.052
關於這一點…
Um, about that...

2104
02:40:36.302 --> 02:40:38.471
索爾，你的人民需要國王
Thor, your people need a king.

2105
02:40:38.638 --> 02:40:40.515
不，他們已經有一個了
No, they already have one.

2106
02:40:42.642 --> 02:40:43.643
真好笑
That's funny.

2107
02:40:49.232 --> 02:40:51.067
你是認真的嗎？
Are you being serious?

2108
02:40:54.738 --> 02:40:56.990
我該做真正的自己了
It's time for me to be who I am...

2109
02:40:57.574 --> 02:41:00.160
而非做我該做的那個人
rather than who I'm supposed to be.

2110
02:41:01.453 --> 02:41:03.204
但妳是領袖
But you, you're a leader.

2111
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:05.540
優秀而稱職
That's who you are.

2112
02:41:08.043 --> 02:41:10.003
我會讓這裡改頭換面
You know, I'd make a lot of changes around here.

2113
02:41:10.170 --> 02:41:11.671
我滿心期待
I'm counting on it...

2114
02:41:11.838 --> 02:41:13.340
陛下
Your Majesty.

2115
02:41:23.475 --> 02:41:24.684
你有什麼打算？
What will you do?

2116
02:41:25.435 --> 02:41:26.853
還不確定
I'm not sure.

2117
02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:30.565
千年來我第一次沒有方向
For the first time in a thousand years,

2118
02:41:30.732 --> 02:41:32.150
不過我能搭便車
I have no path. I do have a ride though.

2119
02:41:32.317 --> 02:41:34.277
動作快，乞幫幫主
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2120
02:41:35.862 --> 02:41:38.615
（搜尋中）

2121
02:41:38.782 --> 02:41:40.325
到了
Oh, here we are!

2122
02:41:40.784 --> 02:41:42.327
樹仔，真高興見到你
Tree, good to see you.

2123
02:41:46.915 --> 02:41:50.210
阿斯嘉星際異攻隊再度合體
The Asgardians of the Galaxy back together again.

2124
02:41:50.627 --> 02:41:52.504
先去哪裡？
Where to first?

2125
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:54.673
嘿
Hey.

2126
02:41:55.298 --> 02:41:57.258
別忘了，這還是我的船
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

2127
02:41:57.425 --> 02:41:58.426
我是老大
I'm in charge.

2128
02:41:58.968 --> 02:42:01.513
我知道，當然
I know. I know. Of course you are.

2129
02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:03.223
當然
Of course.

2130
02:42:05.850 --> 02:42:08.395
你說當然，卻又觸摸地圖
See, you say, "Of course," but then you touch the map.

2131
02:42:08.561 --> 02:42:11.064
讓我覺得你不明白我是老大
It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

2132
02:42:11.690 --> 02:42:13.024
鬼爾，是你沒有安全感
Quail, that's your own insecurities in there.

2133
02:42:13.191 --> 02:42:14.192
鬼爾？
Quail?

2134
02:42:14.359 --> 02:42:16.611
我只是想出一分力幫忙
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service and assisting.

2135
02:42:16.778 --> 02:42:17.987
是奎爾
Quill.

2136
02:42:18.154 --> 02:42:19.030
我是這麼說啊
That's what I said.

2137
02:42:19.197 --> 02:42:21.574
你們該幹一架，看誰是老大
You should fight one another for the honour of leadership.

2138
02:42:21.741 --> 02:42:23.118
聽起來很公平
Sounds fair.

2139
02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:28.248
-沒必要啦 -不必
- It's not necessary, okay? - It's not.

2140
02:42:28.415 --> 02:42:30.792
我有爆能槍，除非你們想用刀子
I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.

2141
02:42:30.959 --> 02:42:33.169
對！拜託用刀子
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2142
02:42:33.336 --> 02:42:34.421
對，刀子
Yeah. Knives.

2143
02:42:34.587 --> 02:42:36.131
我是格魯特
I am Groot.

2144
02:42:41.886 --> 02:42:43.263
沒必要
Not necessary.

2145
02:42:43.430 --> 02:42:44.889
我們不會拿刀捅來捅去
There shall be no knifing one another.

2146
02:42:45.056 --> 02:42:48.059
大家都知道誰是老大
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2147
02:42:51.646 --> 02:42:52.856
我
Me.

2148
02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:54.774
對吧？
Right?

2149
02:42:55.692 --> 02:42:57.902
對，是你
Yes, you.

2150
02:42:58.153 --> 02:43:00.572
當然…
Of course! Of course.

2151
02:43:00.739 --> 02:43:02.407
當然
Of course.

2152
02:43:04.159 --> 02:43:05.702
記住…
Remember...

2153
02:43:06.536 --> 02:43:08.830
必須將寶石放回取得的時間
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em...

2154
02:43:08.997 --> 02:43:12.208
否則會引發許多麻煩的替代現實
or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2155
02:43:12.375 --> 02:43:13.376
放心，布魯斯
Don't worry, Bruce.

2156
02:43:13.918 --> 02:43:15.795
我不會節外生枝
Clip all the branches.

2157
02:43:16.338 --> 02:43:18.089
我試過
You know, I tried.

2158
02:43:19.382 --> 02:43:24.202
我拿到手套和寶石時，試過救她回來
When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back.

2159
02:43:26.890 --> 02:43:28.516
我好想她
I miss her, man.

2160
02:43:28.892 --> 02:43:29.893
我也是
Me too.

2161
02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:36.399
你要的話，我能陪你去
You know, if you want, I could come with you.

2162
02:43:38.985 --> 02:43:40.445
你是好人，山姆
You're a good man, Sam.

2163
02:43:40.987 --> 02:43:42.530
但這是我的責任
This one's on me, though.

2164
02:43:46.993 --> 02:43:48.912
我回來之前別幹蠢事
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

2165
02:43:50.747 --> 02:43:51.998
我怎麼能？
How can I?

2166
02:43:52.165 --> 02:43:53.958
愚蠢都被你帶走了
You're taking all the stupid with you.

2167
02:44:01.549 --> 02:44:03.343
我會想你的，兄弟
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2168
02:44:03.718 --> 02:44:05.220
不會有事的，巴奇
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2169
02:44:12.602 --> 02:44:14.396
這需要多久？
How long is this gonna take?

2170
02:44:14.646 --> 02:44:17.399
他需要多久都行，對我們只有五秒鐘
For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds.

2171
02:44:22.487 --> 02:44:23.738
準備好了嗎，隊長？
You ready, Cap?

2172
02:44:23.905 --> 02:44:26.324
回到這裡見，好嗎？
All right, we'll meet you back here, okay?

2173
02:44:26.991 --> 02:44:28.118
沒問題
You bet.

2174
02:44:29.619 --> 02:44:31.204
進入量子領域，三…
Going quantum. Three...

2175
02:44:31.788 --> 02:44:32.622
二…
two...

2176
02:44:33.289 --> 02:44:34.499
一
one.

2177
02:44:36.376 --> 02:44:38.420
返回現場，五…
And returning in five...

2178
02:44:38.586 --> 02:44:39.546
四…
four...

2179
02:44:39.713 --> 02:44:41.548
三，二…
three, two...

2180
02:44:41.715 --> 02:44:43.049
一
one.

2181
02:44:50.306 --> 02:44:51.307
他在哪？
Where is he?

2182
02:44:51.474 --> 02:44:53.226
不知道，他迅速經過時間戳記
I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp.

2183
02:44:53.393 --> 02:44:54.853
應該回來這裡的
He should be here.

2184
02:45:00.358 --> 02:45:01.276
讓他回來
Get him back.

2185
02:45:01.443 --> 02:45:02.569
-我在試 -快讓他回來
- I'm trying. - Get him the hell back.

2186
02:45:02.736 --> 02:45:04.612
-我說我在試 -山姆
- Hey, I said I'm trying. - Sam.

2187
02:45:28.595 --> 02:45:30.180
去吧
Go ahead.

2188
02:45:48.156 --> 02:45:48.907
隊長？
Cap?

2189
02:45:51.242 --> 02:45:52.994
嗨，山姆
Hi, Sam.

2190
02:45:55.997 --> 02:45:59.042
是出了狀況還是進行順利？
So, did something go wrong or did something go right?

2191
02:46:01.169 --> 02:46:05.006
把寶石放回去之後，我想…
Well, after I put the stones back, I thought...

2192
02:46:06.132 --> 02:46:07.467
或許…
maybe...

2193
02:46:07.967 --> 02:46:12.764
我聽東尼的話，好好過日子
I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.

2194
02:46:14.766 --> 02:46:16.893
結果如何？
How'd that work out for ya?

2195
02:46:19.396 --> 02:46:20.814
很棒
It was beautiful.

2196
02:46:22.148 --> 02:46:23.858
我為你高興
Good. I'm happy for you.

2197
02:46:24.025 --> 02:46:25.068
真心的
Truly.

2198
02:46:25.819 --> 02:46:27.112
謝謝
Thank you.

2199
02:46:28.446 --> 02:46:29.698
唯一讓我難過的是
Only thing bumming me out...

2200
02:46:29.864 --> 02:46:33.451
我得活在一個沒有美國隊長的世界
is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.

2201
02:46:34.388 --> 02:46:35.723
Oh.

2202
02:46:37.247 --> 02:46:40.041
這讓我想到
That reminds me.

2203
02:46:48.550 --> 02:46:49.759
拿拿看
Try it on.

2204
02:47:15.285 --> 02:47:16.786
感覺如何？
How does it feel?

2205
02:47:19.372 --> 02:47:21.082
好像是別人的
Like it's someone else's.

2206
02:47:24.127 --> 02:47:25.295
並不是
It isn't.

2207
02:47:38.641 --> 02:47:40.226
謝謝
Thank you.

2208
02:47:41.936 --> 02:47:43.229
我會盡力
I'll do my best.

2209
02:47:48.610 --> 02:47:50.528
因此它是你的
That's why it's yours.

2210
02:47:52.238 --> 02:47:53.615
想跟我聊聊她嗎？
You wanna tell me about her?

2211
02:48:00.205 --> 02:48:01.706
不
No.

2212
02:48:02.123 --> 02:48:04.250
我想不了
No, I don't think I will.
