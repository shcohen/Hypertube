3
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.410
好吧  我们最后再来一次
All right, let's do this one last time.

4
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.510
我叫彼得·帕克
My name is Peter Parker.

5
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.810
我被一只受过辐射的蜘蛛咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

6
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.610
十年来
And for 10 years...

7
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.850
十年来我是唯一的蜘蛛侠
I've been the one and only Spider-Man.

8
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620
剩下的你们肯定都知道了
I'm pretty sure you know the rest.

9
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.790
能力越大  责任越大
With great power comes great responsibility.

10
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.230
我救过一群人  坠入过爱河  拯救过这座城市
I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city.

11
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.100
然后我一而再再而三地拯救
And then I saved the city again and again and again and again.

12
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.630
还有  呃
And I did, uh...

13
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.230
我做这个
I did this.

♪ Get on up Get yourself together ♪

15

♪ Drive that funky soul ♪

16
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.170
我们不必认真地谈论这个事
We don't really talk about this.

17
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.380
看  我是本漫画书  是份麦片
Look, I'm a comic book. I'm a cereal.

18
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.640
我做了一张圣诞专辑
Did a Christmas album.

19
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.310
我有一首很棒的主题曲
I have an excellent theme song.

20
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.380
♪ Spider-man Spider-man ♪

21
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.620
还有不怎么样的冰棒
And a so-so popsicle.

22
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.320
我是说  我看起来更糟了
I mean, I've looked worse.

23
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.690
但经历过这一切后
But after everything...

24
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.220
我还是喜欢当蜘蛛侠
I still love being Spider-Man.

25
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.590
我是说谁不喜欢呢?
I mean, who wouldn't?

26
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.660
所以无论我被揍了多少次
So no matter how many hits I take...

27
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.670
我总能找到办法回来
...I always find a way to come back.

28
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.500
因为在这座城市和被遗忘之间唯一的东西
Because the only thing standing between this city and oblivion

29
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.210
就是我
is me.

30
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.540
唯一一个蜘蛛侠
There's only one Spider-Man.

31

38
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.400

我只是在熨最后一件衬衫
Just ironing my last shirt.

48
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.620
我的笔记本电脑哪去了?
Where's my laptop?

49
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.860
如果你想让我开车送你  我们现在就要动身了
If you want me to drive you, we gotta go now.

50
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.390
不  爸爸  我走路
No, Dad, I'll walk.

51
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.430
私人司机去过一次  -没关系
- Personal chauffeur going once. - It's okay.

52
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.730

56
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.640
等一下嘛
In a minute.

57
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.000
爸爸  打电话给我
Papá! Llamame!

58
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.200
周五见哦
See you Friday.

59
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.980
好的  妈妈  再见
Okay, mami. Hasta luego!

60
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.820
看看谁回来了  怎么了兄弟?
Look who's back. Yo, what's going on, bro?

61
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.200
嘿  我只是路过  你好吗?
Hey, I'm just walking by. How you doin'?

62
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.450
迈尔斯  你在学校好吗?
Miles! Te va bien en la escuela?

63
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.560
我敢肯定很好
Seguro que si

64
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.820
哟  迈尔斯  你昨晚感觉到地震了吗?
Yo, Miles! You feel that earthquake last night?

65
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.890
你在说什么呢?  我昨晚睡得很香
What you talkin' about? I slept like a baby last night.

66
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.790
新学校怎么样?  很轻松
- How's that new school? - So easy.

67
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.060
我们想念你  迈尔斯  -你想我吗? 我还住在这啊
- We miss you, Miles. - You miss me? I still live here!

68
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.300
等等  你想我?
Wait, you miss me?

69
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.010
噢  拜托
Oh, come on.

70
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.010
讲真  爸爸  走路就行了
Seriously, Dad. Walking would've been fine.

71
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.620
星期六你可以多走几步
You can walk plenty on Saturday

72
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.880
前提是你要把那些贴纸撕掉
when you peel those stickers off.

73
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.950
你看到了? 我不清楚那是不是我
You saw that? I don't know if that was me.

74
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.950
还有昨天在克林顿贴的两个
And the two from yesterday on Clinton.

75
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.490
嗯  那些是我干的
Yeah, those were me.

76
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.690
所以  看看那  另一家新开的咖啡店
Soooo... look at that. Another new coffee shop.

77
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.400
你看到了吗?  迈尔斯  -当然
- You see that Miles? - Totally. Yeah.

78
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.330
你看到那个了吗  那个叫啥?  -泡沫派对
You see that one, what's that one called? - Foam Party.

79
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.070
“泡沫派对”  别吧
"Foam Party"? Come on.

80
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.440
大家都在排队  你看那  迈尔斯
And everyone is just linin' up. You see that, Miles

81
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.500
我看到了
I see it.

82
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.110
那是咖啡店还是迪厅啊?
Is that a coffee shop or a disco?

83
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.810
爸  你过时了
Dad, you're old, man.

84
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.310
昨晚有很多
There are multiple reports

85
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.510
关于神秘地震事件的报道
of another mysterious seismic event last night.

86
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.000
接近蜘蛛侠的消息人士称  他正在调查这个问题
Sources close to SpiderMan say he's looking into the problem.

87
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.950
蜘蛛侠  我是说  这家伙每天
Spider-Man. I mean, this guy swings in once a day,

88
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.390
都会戴着他的小面具来一趟  然后不和任何人说话  对吧?
zip-zap-zop in his little mask and answers to no one. Right?

89
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.550
是啊  爸爸
Yeah, Dad.

90
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.060
与此同时  我的人还在外面
And meanwhile my guys are out there,

91
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.490
冒着生命危险  不戴面具
- lives on the line, no masks. - Uh-huh.

92
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.600
露脸  肩负责任
- We show our faces. Accountability.

93
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.460
哦  不  爸爸  开快点  我认识这些孩子
Oh no! Dad, speed up, I know these kids

94
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.460
你懂的  能力越大  责任就越大
You know, with great ability comes great accountability

95
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.060
俗话可不是这么说的  爸爸
That's not even how the saying goes, Dad

96
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.600
我真的很喜欢蜘蛛侠的麦片粥  我会给他的
I do like his cereal though, I'll give him that

97
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.870
哦  天啊  警察不闯红灯吗?
Oh my gosh. Don't cops run red lights?

98
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.700
有人会  但不是你爸爸
Some do... but not your Dad!

105

迈尔斯  你已经坚持两个星期了
Miles, you've given it two weeks.

106
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.890
我们不会再谈这个事了
We're not having this conversation.

107
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.090
我认为这所新学校是精英学校
I just think that this new school is elitist.

108
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.690
“精英学校”?  -我更喜欢
- "Elitist"? - And I would prefer to be

109
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.490

I'm only here 'cause I won that stupid lottery.

112
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.600

No way. You passed the entry test just like everybody else, ok!

艾伦叔叔怎么了?  他是个好人
What's wrong with Uncle Aaron? He's a good guy.

116
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.510
我们都会在生活中做出选择
We all make choices in life.

117
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.040
我觉得现在别无选择
It doesn't feel like I have a choice right now.

118
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.480
你没得选
You Don't！

119
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.060

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.500
你的鞋带松了
Your shoe's untied.

141
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.570

谁能解出这题的XY?
Who can solve this for XY?

146
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.820
这就叫做三段论法
And that is known as a syllogism.

147
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.250
回去读完《远大前程》的两个章节
Tonight, read two chapters of Great Expectations

148
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.820
随堂测验容积和压力
A take-home quiz on volumetric pressure.

149
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.160
五页纸的论文  结论是重点
A five page essay with your conclusions stressed.

150
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.000
工人党
Workers Party

151
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.100
家庭作业
Take-home Work

152
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.770
会有无数种可能
...countless other possibilities.

153
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.100
在另一个宇宙我可能穿的是红衣服
There could be a universe where I am wearing red.

154
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.710
又或者是皮裤
Or wearing leather pants.

155
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.040
偷偷溜进来的莫拉莱斯先生  你又迟到了
Mr. Morales, moving in the dark. You're late again.

156
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.610
爱因斯坦说过时间是相对的  不是吗?
Einstein said time was relative, right?

157
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.790
或许我没有迟到  只是你们早到了
Maybe I'm not late. Maybe you guys are early.

158
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.790
抱歉  我只是觉得太安静了
Sorry. It was just so quiet.

159
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.650
你是想继续站着还是坐下呢?
Would you like to keep standing there or do you want to sit down?

160
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.060
我们所处的宇宙  其实是多个平行宇宙中的一个
Our universe is, in fact, one of many parallel universes

161
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.130
这些平行宇宙是同时存在的
happening at the exact same time.

162
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.940
多亏了菲斯克家族科研基金会的所有人
Thanks to everyone here at the Fisk Family Foundation for the Sciences...

163
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.140
我喜欢你的笑话  -真的吗?
- I liked your joke. - Really?

164
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.540
我的意思是这并不好笑  所以我才会笑
I mean, it wasn't funny. That's why I laughed.

165
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.780
不过想法不错  所以我喜欢
But it was smart, so I liked it.

166
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.800
我好像之前没见过你
I don't think I've seen you before.

167
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.400
嘘
Shhhhh!

168
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.710
我们所做的每一个选择
Every choice that we make

169
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.020
都会创造出各种可能性
would create countless other possibilities.

170
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.560
而这些可能性是无穷的
A what-if to infinity.

171
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.130
零鸭蛋?  再多拿几个零分
A zero? A few more of those,

172
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.700
你应该就会把我开除了吧?
you'd probably have to kick me outta here, huh?

173
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.060
或许我不适合这个学校
Maybe I'm just not right for this school.

174
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.500
如果一个人闭着眼睛
If a person wearing a blind fold

175
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.000
在一堆判断题里随便乱选
picked the answers on a true or false quiz at random,

176
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.870
你猜准确率是多少?
do you know what score they would get?

177
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.600
百分之五十?
Fifty percent?

178
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.300
回答正确
That's right!

179
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:33.770
等等
Wait wait!

180
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.910
能正确避开所有正确答案
The only way to get all the answers wrong

181
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.210
那就证明你其实全都会
is to know which answers are right.

182
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.840
你故意想被开除
You're trying to quit.

183
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.320
我是不会答应的
And I'm not gonna let you.

184
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.620
我要罚你写篇关于自己的文章
I'm assigning you a personal essay.

185
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.320
不是关于物理  而是关于你自己的
Not about physics, but about you,

186
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.990
你想成为什么样的人

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.860
什么?
What?

279
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.960
我为什么会出那么多汗?
Why am I so sweaty?

280
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.600
你为什么出那么多汗?
Why are you so sweaty?

281
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.930
因为我在发育
It's a puberty thing.

282
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.700
我也不知道自己为什么那么说  我没有在发育
I don't know why I said that. I'm not going through puberty.

283
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.410
我是说  我已经成熟了
I did, but I'm done.

284
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.980
我现在是个男人
I'm a man.

285
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.480
你也是新来的  对吧?  这点我们一样
So you're, like, new here, right? We got that in common.

286
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.180
没错  这是其中一点
Yeah, that's one thing.

287
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.550
真棒  对  我叫迈尔斯
Cool, yeah. I'm Miles.

288
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.650
我叫格温达
I'm G-Waaaanda.

289
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.420
等等  你叫格温达?
Wait, your name is Gwanda?

290
00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.060
没错  非洲名  我是南非人
Yes, it's African. I'm South African.

291
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.190
我从小在这里长大  所以没口音
No accent though 'cause I was raised here.

292
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.600
快使出搭肩膀那招  趁她还没走
Do the shoulder touch now! Before she walks away!

293
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.200
为什么感觉这么慌?
Why is this so scary?

294
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.280
是我在做慢动作  还是就是这种感觉
Am I doing this in slow motion or does it just feel that way?

295
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.420
逗你的  我叫温达  没有“格” 开个玩笑
I'm kidding. It's Wanda. No G. That's crazy.

296
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.180
嘿
Hey.

297
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.720
好吧  那么  我们回头见
OK then. I'll see you around.

298
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.060
回见
Oh. See you.

299
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.030
抱歉  -嘿
- Sorry. Um... - Hey.

300
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.130
怪了  -放开我好吗?
- Oh, crap. - Can you let go, please?

301
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.670
我不行  -别乱动  没关系
- I can't let go. - Ow! Ow! Calm down. It's fine.

302
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.350
迈尔斯  放开
Miles, let go!

303
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.400
我也想  这都要怪青春期
I'm working on it. It's just puberty!

304
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:50.440
我想你对青春期的定义有些误解  听着  放轻松
I don't think you know what puberty is! Just relax.

305
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.110
好吧  我有个主意  -很好
Okay, I have a plan. - Great.

306
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.310
我要使劲扯了  -这是个愚蠢的主意
- I'm gonna pull really hard. - That's a terrible plan.

307
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.450
一  -别那么做
- One. - Don't do this.

308
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.610
二  三
- Two. - Three!

309
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.790
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

310
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.990
是的  特别高兴
Sure. Total pleasure.

311
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.770
没人看到  没关系
No one saw. It's ok.

312
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.670
没人知道  没人知道
No one knows, no one knows.

313
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.340
大家都知道了
Everyone knows.

314
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.210
大家都知道了  他们在嘲笑我
Everyone knows! They're talkin' 'bout me.

315
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.250
他们都看到了
They saw everything!

316
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.050
他知道  她知道  他们都知道
He knows. She knows. They know.

317
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.480
哇  他长得可真高
Wow, she's super tall.

318
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.550
他为什么在笑?  我现在成怪胎了吗?
Why is he smiling? Am I the weird guy now?

319
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.550
我在干吗?
What am I doing?

320
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.750
那家伙真是个怪人
That guy's such a weirdo.

321
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.490
我怎么停下来?
How do I stop?

322
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.320
他们能听到我的心声?
Can they hear my thoughts?!

323
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.090
我的心声怎么会那么大声?
Why are all my thoughts so loud?!

324
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.760
嘿  我知道你昨晚溜出去了  莫拉莱斯
Hey! I know you snuck out last night, Morales.

325
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.330
装傻
Play dumb!

326
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.670
谁是莫拉莱斯?
Who's Morales?

327
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.540
也别那么傻
Not that dumb!

328
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.140
嘿
Hey!

329
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.740
好了  好了  没事了
Okay, okay. You're okay.

330
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.100
没事了
You're okay.

331
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.350
安保主管
没事了
You're okay.

332
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.770
他找不到你的
He'll never find you.
安保主管

333
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.210
他找不到你的
He'll never find you.

334
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.550
不是吧
No.

335
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.400
安保

336
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.000
你在我办公室里做什么?  莫拉莱斯  快开门

Keep sticking, Miles! Oh!

345
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.130
霍夫施塔特提出了
Hofstadter is suggesting...

346
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.660
他提出了
...is that we...

347
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.260
我们都应该
...look on the...

348

《蜘蛛侠的真实生活》

351
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.750
为什么会这样?
"Why is this happening?"

352
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.190
别再粘着了
"Please stop sticking."

353
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.420

"Please keep st..."

354

等等  等等
Wait! Wait!

355
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.360
怎么可能有两个蜘蛛侠?
How could there be two Spider-Men?

356
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.260
不可能有两个蜘蛛侠
There can't be two Spider-Men.

357
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.830
可能吗?
Can there?

358
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.830
《两个蜘蛛侠》

359
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.300
拜托  艾伦叔叔  快接电话
Come on Uncle Aaron. Pick up. Pick up.

360
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.270

Yo, it's Aaron. I'm outta town for a few days. Hit you when I'm back. Peace.

361
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.990
不  不  不  不  这不可能
No nononono. It's not possible.

362
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.380
只是在发育
It's just puberty.

363
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.250
那是只普通的蜘蛛  我是个普通的男孩儿
It's a normal spider and I'm a normal kid!

364
00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.690
好
All right!

365
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.400
当天晚上

366
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.790
迈尔斯正在寻找答案

367
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.900
我得找人聊聊
I gotta tell someone.

368
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.590
是你想多了  迈尔斯  你想多了
You're being crazy Miles. You're being crazy.

369
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.700
找到那只蜘蛛  一切就清楚了
Find the spider. You'll see.

370
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.710
是只普通蜘蛛
It's a normal spider.

371
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.920
感觉简直普通得不能再普通了
It's, like, boring how normal this spider is.

372
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.660
我就在这儿
I'm right here.

373
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.930
为什么偏偏是我?
Why is this happening to me?

374
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.640
慢点  我这是在做什么?
Slow down! What am I doing?

375
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.780
在那边
Way over there.

376
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.940
你跟我一样
You're like me.

377
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.780
迈尔斯  小心
Miles. Look out.

378
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.480
我不想当英雄
I don't wanna be a hero.

379
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.550
迈尔斯
Miles.

380
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.720
诺曼  你听我说
Norman, listen to me.

381
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.460
蜘蛛侠?
Spider-Man?!

382
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.400
我不能让你打开通往另一个时空的大门
I cannot let you open a portal to another dimension.

383
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.500
布鲁克林承受不了这个
Brooklyn is not zoned for that.

384
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.640
这不是我能决定的
It's not up to me.

385
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.370
那是绿恶魔吗?
Is that Green Goblin!?

386
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.910
你为什么不能放弃?
Why won't you quit?!

387
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.840
因为我不想布鲁克林被黑洞吞噬
I don't know I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked into a black hole.

388
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.540
我还是先走为妙
I think I'm gonna go...

389
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.480
斯塔顿岛可以  反正布鲁克林不行
Staten Island maybe, Not Brooklyn!

390
00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.620
不  不
No, no!

391
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.950
哇靠
Woah!!

392
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.350
现在怎么办?
What now?

393
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.780
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

394
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.610
知不知道你鞋带松了?
Did you know your shoes are untied?

395
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.750
嗯哼  -我穿的是连体服
- Uh-huh. - This is a onesie,

396
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.680
所以不用担心
so I don't really have to worry about it.

397
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.720
我以为我是唯一的  你和我一样
I thought I was the only one. You're like me.

398
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.160
我可不想
I don't want to be.

399
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.060
恐怕你没得选  孩子
I don't think you have a choice, kiddo.

400
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.630
我能理解你的困惑  相信我
Got a lot going through your head, I'm sure.

401
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.930
当然
Yeah...

402
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.470
你不会有事的  我可以帮你
You're gonna be fine. I can help you.

403
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.840
你等我一下  一会儿我教你两招
If you stick around, I can show you the ropes.

404
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.170
好的
Yeah.

405
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.510
我必须得赶在时空连续体崩塌之前
I just need to destroy this big machine real quick

406
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.580
毁掉那台机器
before the space-time continuum collapses.

407
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.550
别走开
Don't move.

408
00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.150
一会儿见
See you in a bit.

409
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.530
他是怎么做到的?
How does he do that?

410
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.070
是在这儿吗?  不  不  在这儿
Is it here? No, no. Is here

411
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.500
好了  各位
All right, folks.

412
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.640
我总是搞错
I always get this wrong.

413
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.040
糟糕
Oh boy.

414
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.010
徘徊者
Prowler.

415
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.920
伙计 我正忙着呢
Man, I was in the middle of something.

416
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.090
心好累
I am so tired...

417
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.960
你还在生我的气吗?  我觉得你在生我的气
Are you mad at me? I feel like you're mad at me.

418
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.640
你就这点能耐?
Is that all you got?

419
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.740
真恶心
Uhh, so gross.

420
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.870
我应该上去帮他
I should go up there and help him!

421
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.640
开什么玩笑?  这怎么可能
Who am I kidding? I should not do that.

422
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.120
注意  蜘蛛侠来了
Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man.

423
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.120
喜欢我的新玩具吗?
You like my new toy?

424
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.560
花了我不少钱  不过钱财乃身外之物  对吧?
Cost me a fortune, but, hey, can't take it with you, right?

425
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.830
你大老远跑来  观看我的试验
You came all this way. Watch the test.

426
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.260
这会是场超炫的灯光秀
It's a hell of a freaking light show.

427
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.200
你一定会喜欢的
You're gonna love this.

428
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.850
探针已激活

429
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.110
不  不  别这样  快停下
No! No, don't do this! Stop!

430
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.580
你不知道它能做什么  你会害死我们的
You don't know what it can do! You'll kill us all!

431
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.090
传送门正在开启  我看到了多个宇宙正在开启
The portal is opening. I see multiple dimensions opening!

432
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:34.060
三个  四个  五个不同的宇宙
That was 3... 4... and 5 separate dimensions

433
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.070
它们很不稳定  得马上停止
It's unstable... we should stop.

434
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.050
诺曼  你一般怎么处理头部创伤?
Norm, what's your take on head trauma?

435
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.890
我都提醒你了
I tried to warn you, pal.

436
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.000
警 告

437
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.740
绿恶魔  不  把他弄出来
Goblin, no! Get him out of there!

438
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.850
威尔逊  我们在哪里?
Wilson! Where are we?

439
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.620
真奇怪
Really weird.

440
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.990
威尔逊
Wilson!

441
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.990
嘿  你没事吧?
Hey! Are you okay?

442
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.020
我没事  我没事  只是需要休息一下
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just resting.

443
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.690
你还能站起来吗?-当然
- Can't you get up? - Yeah.

444
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.890
我每次都能站起来
Yeah, yeah I always get up...

445
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.730
咳嗽可能不是好兆头
The coughing's probably not a good sign.

446
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.770
找到他  快
Find him. Now.

447
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.070
听着  我们得合作  时间不多了
Listen, we gotta team up here, we don't have that much time...

448
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.940
只有这把重载钥匙能阻止对撞机
This override key is the only way to stop the collider.

449
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.640
荡过去  用这把钥匙  按下红色按钮  炸飞他
Swing up there, use this key, push the button and blow it up.

450
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.980
你得把脸藏起来
You need to hide your face.

451
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.210
别告诉任何人你是谁
You don't tell anyone who you are.

452
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.280
谁都不能说  他能撬开任何人的嘴
No one can know. He's got everyone in his pocket.

453
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.150
什么?  -如果他再次启动机器
-What?  - If he turns the machine on again,

454
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.090
你所知道的一切都会消失
everything you know will disappear.

455
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.020
你的家人  所以人
Your family, everyone.

456
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.420
所有人
Everyone.

457
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.830
答应我好吗
Promise me you'll do this.

458
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.700
我答应你
I promise.

459
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.670
去吧  毁了对撞机
Go. Destroy the collider.

460
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.140
我会去找你的
I'll come and find you.

461
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.040
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

462
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:05.850
墓碑
Tombstone.

463
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.050
试验到此结束
We're done with tests.

464
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.020
尽快准备好再启动一次
Get that thing ready to go again. And soon.

465
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.300
快点跑  这群家伙真没用
Run faster. These guys are weak.

466
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.700
本想说很高兴又见到你了  蜘蛛侠  可惜不是
I'd say it's nice to see you again, Spider-Man. But it's not.

467
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.330
嘿  金并  生意好吗?
Hey Kingpin. How's business?

468
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.930
很火爆哈
Booming. Ha!

469
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.270
很好  好吧  这样可不行
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

470
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.870
你这么做会在布鲁克林的下面撕开一个黑洞
This might open a black hole under Brooklyn.

471
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.310
不能冒这个险
It can't be worth the risk.

472
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.150
不是所有事都是为了钱  蜘蛛侠
It's not always about the money, Spider-Man.

473
00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.980
你不想知道我看到了什么吗?
Don't you want to know what I saw in there?

474
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.060
等等
Wait.

475
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.290
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're trying to do,

476
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.090
这么做没用的
and it won't work.

477
00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.200
他们已经死了
They're gone.

478
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.780
把尸体处理掉
Get rid of the body.

479
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.380
那是什么?
What was that?

480
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.320
杀了他
Kill that guy.

481
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.450
别粘着了
Stop sticking!

482
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.980
请勿倚靠车门  谢谢
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

483
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.870
应该是班克斯风格的街头艺术
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

484
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.200
市民反映  纽约又一起神秘地震事件
New Yorkers are reporting sporadic

485
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.500
导致了本市多处断电
power outages in the wake of another strange seismic event...

486
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.150
警察  举起手来
Police! Put your hands up!

487
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.880
迈尔斯?
Miles? Miles?

488
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.620
你怎么不在学校?
Why aren't you at school?

489
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.950
没事了
Whoa, whoa, it's ok.

490
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.220
迈尔斯?  出什么事了?
Miles? ¿Qué te pasa?

491
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.300
是因为地震吗?
Is it the earthquake?

492
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.600
我今晚能留下吗?
Can I sleep here tonight?

493
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.260
迈尔斯  今天不是周末
Miles, it's a weeknight.

494
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.850
你应该待在学校的
You made a commitment to that school.

495
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.810
杰夫  他不舒服
Jeff, he's upset.

496
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.210
你当然能留下
Of course you can stay.

497
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.980
爸爸?  -怎么?
Dad? - Yeah?

498
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.180
你真的很讨厌蜘蛛侠吗?
Do you really hate Spider-Man?

499
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.980
是吧  我是说  身为一名警察
Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is...

500
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.290
杰夫  亲爱的
Jeff, mi amor

501
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.250
怎么了?  是他问我的
What? He asked me.

502
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.890
你知道我对蜘蛛侠的看法
Baby, you know how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on.

503
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.030
你知道他很爱你
Tú sabes que él te quiere mucho.

504
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.960
所以才会这么严格  你懂的  对吧?
That's why he's tough on you. You know that, right?

505
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.340
妈妈  你有没有想过离开布鲁克林?
Mom, do you ever think about moving out of Brooklyn?

506
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:49.040
我们家的人从不逃避问题  迈尔斯
Our family doesn't run from things, Miles.

507
00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.180
对  我知道
Yeah, I know.

508
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.510
那是怎么回事?
What's that about?

509
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.280
他正处于艰难期  杰夫
He's having a hard time, Jeff.

510
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.550
越是艰难  他越是应该坚持
When it gets hard, that's when he's gotta stick it out.

511
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.550
嘘  你应该更温柔一点
Shhhh. Tiene que mas suave.

512
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.130
插播一条特别消息

他曾经是一个普通人

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.510
他总是说谁都能成为面具后面的那个人
He always said it could've been anyone behind the mask.

530
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:01.410
他只是凑巧被蜘蛛咬了而已
He was just the kid who happened to get bit.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.700
没有你
I'm not sure I'm the guy.

559
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.630
我一个人根本不行
I can't do this without you.

560
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.200
嘿  孩子
Hey! Kid!

561
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.180
我对他做了什么?
What did I do to him? Uh...

562
00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.590
不
No...

563
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.730
你是谁?
Who are you?

564
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:39.730
你是谁?

565
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.870
好吧  各位  我们最后再来一次
All right, people, let's do this one last time.

566
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.200
《超凡蜘蛛侠》
我叫做彼得·本杰明·帕克
My name is Peter B. Parker.

567
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.400
我叫做彼得·本杰明·帕克
My name is Peter B. Parker.

568
00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:50.610
我被一只受过辐射的蜘蛛咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

569
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.840
在接下来的二十二年里
And for the last 22 years,

570
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.580
我认为我是这世上唯一的蜘蛛侠
I thought I was the one and only Spider-Man.

571
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.420
忙碌的一天
What a day...

572
00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.750
剩下的你们肯定都知道了
I'm pretty sure you know the rest.

573
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.650
我救过这座城市  坠入过爱河  还结了婚
You see, I saved the city, fell in love, I got married,

574
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.820
又救了几次城市  或许太多了
saved the city some more, maybe too much.

575
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.400
我的婚姻出现了危机  投资了一些糟糕的项目
My marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices.

576
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.150
市场形势大好  买买买
我的婚姻出现了危机  投资了一些糟糕的项目
My marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices.

577
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.600
我的婚姻出现了危机  投资了一些糟糕的项目
My marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices.

578
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:09.730
小 蜘 蛛 餐 厅 真 恶 心
我的婚姻出现了危机  投资了一些糟糕的项目
My marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices.

579
00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:10.500
千万别投以蜘蛛侠为名的主题餐厅
Don't invest in a spider-themed restaurant.
小 蜘 蛛 餐 厅 真 恶 心

580
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.150
千万别投以蜘蛛侠为名的主题餐厅
Don't invest in a spider-themed restaurant.

581
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.800
小蜘蛛餐厅
关门大吉
千万别投以蜘蛛侠为名的主题餐厅
Don't invest in a spider-themed restaurant.

582
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:11.900
千万别投以蜘蛛侠为名的主题餐厅
Don't invest in a spider-themed restaurant.

583
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.830
就这样过去了十五年  吧啦  吧啦  吧啦  超级无聊
Then like 15 years passed. Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.

584
00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.470
我摔断了脊背  脸撞在了无人机上
I broke my back, a drone flew into my face,

585
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:18.530
送走了梅婶婶
I buried Aunt May.

586
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.640
最后和我的妻子分开了
My wife and I split up.

587
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.870
但这一切我都沉着以对
But I handled it like a champion.

588
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.740
你知道吗
'Cause, you know what,

589
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.580
不管遭受多少次打击
no matter how many times I get hit,

590
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.480
我最终总是会爬起来
I always get back up.

591
00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.650
我有大把的时间自我反省
And I got a lot of time to reflect and work on myself.

592
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.790
知道吗? 海马一旦结合就再也不会分开
Did you know that seahorses, that they mate for life?

593
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:41.760
你能想象吗?
Could you imagine?

594
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.930
一只海马见到了另一只海马
A seahorse seeing another seahorse

595
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.830
然后他们就成了
and then making it work?

596
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.550
她想要孩子  可是这吓坏我了
She wanted kids and it scared me.

597
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.570
我知道我伤了她的心
I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.

598
00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.940
闪进  当时我正在家里做俯卧撑
Flash forward, I'm in my apartment doing pushups,

599
00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.980
还有仰卧起坐  让自己变得更强
doing ab crunches, getting strong,

600
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.350
突然奇怪的事发生了
when this weird thing happened.

601
00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.680
虽然我对奇怪的事已经见惯不怪
And I gotta say, weird things happen to me a lot.

602
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.650
可是这次的情况真的很奇怪
But this was real weird.

603
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:58.100
我还在纽约  可周围不太一样
You see I was in New York, but... things were different.

604
00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.800
而且我死了
Also, I was dead.

605
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.470
还有一头金发
And blond.

606
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.710
我看起来简直完美
I was kind of perfect.

607
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:08.510
感觉就像在照镜子一样
It was like looking in a mirror.

608
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.550
我有种直觉
I have a feeling that the thing

609
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.980
带我来到这儿的东西
that brought me here

610
00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.880
就是害死他的原因
was the thing that got him killed.

611
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.920
想知道接下来发生了什么吗?
You wanna know what happened next?

612
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.460
我也想知道
Me too.

613
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.930
你是谁?
Who are you?

614
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.900
你在哪儿干什么?
What are you doing over there?

615
00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.360
别动  纽约警察
Freeze! P.D.N.Y.

616
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.440
站住
Stop!

617
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.470
这是在逗我吗?
Are you kidding me right now?

618
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.940
站住 站住
Stop! Stop!

619
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.640
我抓住了
I gotcha. I gotcha.

620
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.450
嘿  小子  放下尸体
Hey kid, drop the body!

621
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.580
嘿  小子  快过来
Hey kid! Get over here!

622
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.690
回头见  警官
See ya, officers!

623
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:51.960
不是吧
Oh come on

624
00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:01.060
嘿  小子  别乱动  举起手  孩子
Hey kid! C'mon now! Put em' up, son!

625
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.170
再见
Adios?

626
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.980
救命  快让列车停下
Help! Somebody stop that train!

627
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:33.160
嘿  什么情况?
Oh, hey, what the...?

628
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:37.540
抱歉
Sorry

629
00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.480
要死翘翘啦
I'm gonna die!

630
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.950
情况好像是一个打扮成蜘蛛侠的孩子
Looks like a child dressed like Spider-Man

631
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.050
拖着一个流浪汉的尸体在追赶列车
dragging a homeless corpse behind a train.

632
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.590
太好了  我没杀了你
Yes! I didn't kill you!

633
00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.770
你是谁?
Who are you?

634
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:58.400
你又是谁?
Who are you?

635
00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.760
你为什么想要杀我?
Why are you trying to kill me?

636
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.530
我没有  我是想要救你
I'm not! I'm trying to save you!

637
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.080
麻烦绕道走好吗?
Hey, maybe you guys can go around?

638
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.720
好吧  谢谢配合
All right. Thanks, New York.

639
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.590
什么情况?
What was that?

640
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.130
那孩子电击了我
Kid electrocuted me

641
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.000
用他的手吗?
with his hands?

642
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.150
你和我一样
You're like me.

643
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.800
我有话要问你
I got some questions.

644
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.140
你为什么那么像彼得·帕克?
Why do you look like Peter Parker?

645
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.150
因为我就是彼得·帕克
Because I am Peter Parker.

646
00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.020
那你怎么没死?  头发为什么不一样了?
Then why aren't you dead? And why is your hair different?

647
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.550
为什么你变老了?  还有你的体型
Why are you older? And why is your body

648
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.020
怎么变形了?
a different shape?

649
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.150
你是想说我胖是吧
Pretty sure you just called me fat.

650
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:08.250
不  不  只是
No, no you just

651
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.790
你也没帅到哪儿去  小子
You don't look so hot either, kid.

652
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.930
超级英雄不会买自己的周边
Most superheroes don't wear their own merch.

653
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:12.500
你是鬼魂吗?
Are you a ghost?

654
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.060
不是
No

655
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:13.990
你是僵尸吗?
Are you a zombie?

656
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.530
住嘴
Stop it

657
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.000
我是僵尸吗?
Am I a zombie?

658
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.800
别扯淡了
You're not even close

659
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.900
你来自另一个时空?
Are you from another dimension?

660
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.900
就像平行宇宙
Like a parallel universe

661
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.270
彼此相似但却又不相同
where things are like this universe but different?

662
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.140
你是那里的蜘蛛侠
And you're Spider-Man in that universe?

663
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.040
然后你穿越到了这里
But somehow traveled to this universe,

664
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.210
而你并不知道原因
but you don't know how?

665
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.840
你真的只是随便猜猜的?
Wow. That was really just a guess?

666
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.710
其实  我们在物理课上学过
Well, we learned about it in physics.

667
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:29.550
量子理论
Quantum theory.

668
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.820
这太酷了  那你就可以像彼得说的那样教我了
This is amazing. You can teach me just like Peter said he would.

669
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.920
在他生前
Before he died.

670
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.500
对  没错
Yeah, exactly.

671
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.190
好吧
Yeah, alright.

672
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.950
听着  我答应过他的
Look I made a promise to him.

673
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.650
我现在就来教你第一课  小子
Here's lesson number one, kid.

674
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.760
别光顾着听  要仔细看
Don't watch the mouth. Watch the hands.

675
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.230
彼得  我是认真的
Peter, seriously.

676
00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.600
相信我  孩子  这样你会过得轻松些
Trust me, kid, this'll all make you a better Spider-Man.

677
00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.310
嘿  你还好吗?
Hey, are you okay?

678
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.710
不  很不好
No I'm not.

679
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.110
你的身体怎么了?
What's going on with your body?

680
00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.010
我的原子可能不太适应
I don't think my atoms are real jazzed

681
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.780
这个错误的时空
about being in the wrong dimension.

682
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.950
听着  我不是来应聘兼职
Look, I'm not looking for a side gig

683
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.360
做蜘蛛侠教练的
as a Spider-Man coach.

684
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.660
在我的世界我还有很多事情要处理
I got a lot going on in my dimension.

685
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.760
能力越大  责任就
With great power comes great...

686
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.360
别在我面前说那句话
Don't you dare finish that sentence.

687
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.130
别再说了  我受够了
don't do it. I'm sick of it.

688
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.900
想要我的意见?  做回个普通小孩吧
Want my advice? Go back to being a regular kid.

689
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.070
我根本没得选
I don't have a choice!

690
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.640
金并造了一架对撞机
Kingpin's got a supercollider.

691
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.750
他想要杀了我
He's tryin' to kill me.

692
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:32.850
等等  你刚才说什么?
Wait a second, what did you just say?

693
00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.150
金并想要杀了我
Kingpin's trying to kill me.

694
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.240
谁关心这个?  对撞机在哪里?
Who cares about that? Where's the collider?

695
00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.110
布鲁克林  菲斯克大楼下面
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower

696
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:38.650
再见
Goodbye!

697
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.280
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

698
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.450
等它再启动时  只要跳进去就能回家了
When it runs again, I'll just jump in and get back to my life

699
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:42.380
你不能重启对撞机
- You can't let them run it.

700
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.950
我的任务就是毁了它
I'm supposed to destroy it

701
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.020
阻止它再次启动  否则所有人都会死
so it never runs again or everyone's gonna die.

702
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.690
否则所有人都会死  他们每次都爱说这句话
Or everyone's going to die. That is what they always say.

703
00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.700
但在“所有人都会死”之前总还会有点时间
But there's always a little bit of time before everybody dies,

704
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.060
这时就要看我的了
and that's when I do my best work.

705
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.760
你难道不需要这个吗?
Aren't you going to need this?

706
00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.370
你有个小玩意儿  交给我
Ah you have a goober. Give it.

707
00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.840
等等  不  没那么容易  他管它叫重载钥匙
Wait, no. Not so fast. He called it an override key.

708
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.670
总会有把漏洞钥匙  病毒钥匙  各种乱七八糟的钥匙
There's always a bypass key, a virus key, a who-cares key.

709
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:04.400
记都记不清
I can never remember,

710
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.140
所以索性叫它们小玩意儿  交给我
so I always call it a goober. Give it.

711
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.880
我需要它帮我摧毁对撞机
I need it to destroy the collider.

712
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.280
我需要它帮我回家
I need it to go home!

713
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.880
不  再逼我  我就吞了它
No! I'll swallow it, don't play with me!

714
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.020
什么?  - 我说
- What? - I said...

715
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.420
对撞机打开了入口  把我带到了这里
The collider created a portal that brought me here.

716
00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.050
所以我得
And I have to get...

717
00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:21.190
你把它搞坏?  - 不  本来就是坏的
Did you break this? - No, it broke.

718
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.820
我不记得发生了什么
I don't remember what happened.

719
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.800
看到没  所以我才不要孩子  简直太明智了
This is why I never had kids, this is why I never did that.

720
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.930
我们不能再做一个吗?
Can't we make another one?

721
00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:27.960
不  这里没你什么事  多亏了你
No, we can't do anything. Thanks to you,

722
00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.930
我得重复那个家伙的工作  去欧克马克斯再偷一次数据
I have to re-steal what your guy stole from Alchemax

723
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.800
做个新钥匙
and make another one of these.

724
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.840
如果你走之后我没能关掉对撞机
If I don't turn off the collider after you leave,

725
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.340
这座城市的每一个人
everyone in this city,

726
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.210
我的父母  我的叔叔  成千上万的人都会死
my parents, my uncle and millions of others, will die.

727
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.880
你打算就这么一走了之
And you're just gonna go home

728
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.180
把我一个人留在这儿面对这一切?
and leave me here to figure this out for myself?

729
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.800
你做得出这种事吗? 蜘蛛侠
- You good with that, Spider-Man?

730
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.400
对
- Yeah.

731
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.390
你蹲在那儿干什么?
What are you doing?

732
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.760
让你良心不安  有效果吗?
Making you feel guilty. Is it working?

733
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.030
怎么可能?  不  你看我
How could it...? No. Look at me.

734
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.800
像有效果的样子吗?
Does it look like it's working?

735
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.340
不  没有  当然没有
No. No, it's not...

736
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.980
不  不  不能让他得逞
Ahhh!!! No! No! Do not let him win!

737
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.420
好吧  孩子  你赢了
Alright kid you win.

738
00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.920
走吧  我们没时间浪费了
C'mon, we don't have a second to lose.

739
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.750
我喜欢这汉堡  太好吃了
Mmm. I love this burger. So delicious.

740
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.720
我吃过的最好吃的汉堡之一
One of the best burgers I've ever had.

741
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.390
在我们那儿  这地方六年前就关门了
In my universe, this place closed six years ago.

742
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.260
真搞不懂  明明很好吃
I don't know why. I really don't.

743
00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.000
你带钱了对吧? 我最近手头紧
You have money right? I'm not very liquid right now.

744
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.050
说正经事好吗?
Can we focus?

745
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:38.800
当然
Uh huh sure.

746
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.340
另一个彼得  -你不吃吗?
- The other Peter... - You gonna eat that?

747
00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:43.770
我在听呢
I'm listening.

748
00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.400
另一个彼得之前说过他会教我几招
The other Peter said he was going to be showing me the ropes.

749
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.010
你有什么蜘蛛侠窍门可以教我吗?
You got any Spider-Man tips you can tell me now?

750
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.010
多了去了
Yeah, I got plenty.

751
00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.450
面具要消毒
Disinfect the mask.

752
00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.920
穿紧身衣要扑点爽身粉
You're gonna wanna use baby powder in the suit,

753
00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.120
尤其是关节部位
heavy on the joints.

754
00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.290
你也不想出疹子  对吧?
You don't want any chafing, right?

755
00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:59.400
还有别的吗?
Anything else?

756
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.790
没了  就这些
Nope, that was everything.

757
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.490
你这老师也太差劲了吧
I think you're going to be a bad teacher.

758
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.030
查查欧克马克斯在哪儿
Mhmm.. Look up where Alchemax is.

759
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:08.400
纽约哈德逊山谷的一家私人科技园区
A private technological campus in Hudson Valley, New York.

760
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.200
你可以教我怎么荡过去
You can teach me to swing on the way there.

761
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.840
我们不可能一路荡到哈德逊山谷  迈尔斯
I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley, Miles.

762
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.780
尤其是吃了汉堡大餐之后
Not after a hearty burger breakfast.

763
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.080
节省点体力  你会感谢我的
Keep your legs fresh. You're gonna thank me later.

764
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.250
♪ I can see a new horizon ♪

765
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.080
♪ Underneath the blazing sky ♪

766
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.250
♪ I'll be where the eagle's Flying higher... ♪

767
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.550
还有别穿斗篷
And it's a no on the cape.

768
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:32.420
我觉得还挺酷的
I think it's cool.

769
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.160
快脱掉  丢死人了
Take that off. It's disrespectful.

770
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.130
蜘蛛侠不穿斗篷
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

771
00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:39.230
我们要怎么重复彼得的工作?
So how do we retrace Peter's steps?

772
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:41.200
这是个好问题
That's a good question.

773
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.040
如果我是我  我会怎么做?
What would I do if I were me?

774
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:46.200
有了
Got it.

775
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.200
第一步  先潜入实验室
Step One: I infiltrate the lab.

776
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.170
第二步  找到首席科学家的电脑
Two: Find the head scientist's computer.

777
00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.380
那位推自行车的女士就是
That lady with the bike is the head scientist.

778
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.440
我在学校的纪录片里见过她
I saw her in this documentary.

779
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.880
很好  第三步  暂时抛开性别歧视
Cool! Step Three: I reexamine my personal biases.

780
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.110
第四步  黑进她的电脑
Step Four: I hack the computer.

781
00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.900
其实也不算黑进去  应该是
It's not technically hacking. It's kinda

782
00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.480
行了  别打断我思路
Not now. I just lost my train of thought.

783
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.420
第五步  下载重要信息
Step Five: Download the important stuff.

784
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.220
看到我就知道
I'll know it when I see it.

785
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.090
第六步  从餐厅抓一个面包圈  然后拔腿就跑
Step Six: I grab a bagel from the cafeteria and run.

786
00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.860
那我要干吗?
So what am I doing?

787
00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.990
第七步  你在这里把风  非常重要
uh Step 7: You stay here, you're lookout. Very important.

788
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.600
听着  伙计  你得教我蜘蛛侠的技能
Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do Spider-Man stuff

789
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.650
这样我才能帮你
or I won't be able to help.

790
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.400
好的
Alright...

791
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.300
学着点  小子  一会儿我来考你
Watch and learn, kid, I'll quiz you later!

792
00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.340
为什么我要和
Why did I get stuck with

793
00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.580
这个又老又挫的流浪蜘蛛侠在一起?
the janky, old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!

794
00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:30.980
新技能
That's new.

795
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.290
金并
Kingpin!

796
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.430
我在干吗?  我在干吗?
What am I doing? What am I doing?

797
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.880
彼得
Peter!

798
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.000
彼得
Peter!

799
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.550
你在这儿干吗?
Yeah, what are you doing here?!

800
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.550
金并来了  你往边上去点儿
Kingpin's here! Just move over!

801
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:14.900
拜托  你压着我的脚了
C'mon! You're stepping on my foot!

802
00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:15.850
往你的右边挪一下
Move a little to your right

803
00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:16.590
赶紧爬出去
Go back outside!

804
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.090
不  我不能该眼睁睁看着蜘蛛侠遇难
No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man die

805
00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.560
自己却什么都不做
without doing anything about it.

806
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.070
我不会再那么做
I'm not doing that again.

807
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.670
干吗?
What?

808
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:28.640
我遇到的人大都想要杀了我
Most people I meet in the workplace try to kill me,

809
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.310
所以换种画风也不错
so you're a nice change of pace.

810
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.500
菲斯克先生
Uh, Mr. Fisk!

811
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.510
请看数据  我知道你不理解
Look at this data. I know you can't really understand it,

812
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.180
但这些都是好消息
but these are really good numbers.

813
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.020
我知道密码了
And... I got the password!

814
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.450
菲斯克先生  如果本周再次重启对撞机
Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week

815
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.090
布鲁克林的下面就会产生一个黑洞
there could be a black hole under Brooklyn.

816
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:46.620
您看这个  还有这个
You see this? And this?

817
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.260
这就是多重宇宙
This is multiple dimensions

818
00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.490
开始互相挤压的迹象
beginning to crash into each other.

819
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.660
这是蜘蛛侠剧情的老套路
This is pretty standard Spider-Man stakes.

820
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.430
要慢慢习惯  看好了
You get used to it. Watch this.

821
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.270
他会说“我再给你24小时”
He's gonna say, "You've got 24 hours."

822
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.570
我再给你24小时
You've got twenty-four hours.

823
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:02.000
这么做的话可能会导致连续时空里出现裂缝
What this means is that there could be a rupture in the space time continuum.

824
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.410
太糟了
Ooh. That's bad.

825
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.010
其实她说的句句都很糟糕
Actually, everything she said was bad.

826
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.010
是我轻敌了
I was lying before.

827
00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:17.360
好吧  等等  还有别的数据
OK hold on, let me show you some more data

828
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.450
你在干吗? 伙计
What're you doing, bud?

829
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:21.980
我动不了
I can't move!

830
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.530
好了  放松你的手指
Okay, relax your fingers.

831
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.560
我们没时间了  放手  放掉就好  进入状态
We don't have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.

832
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.660
我在状态里  而且是糟糕的状态
I am in the moment, it's a terrible moment!

833
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:29.900
我不是在拒绝
I'm not refusing

834
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.340
别再找借口了
No more excuses!

835
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.000
我只是需要时间
I just need more time.

836
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.100
他们就在外面  你会被发现的
They're right there. They're gonna see you.

837
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.040
迈尔斯  你得赶紧松手
Miles, you gotta unstick.

838
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.970
你一般怎么做才会放松?
What do you do to relax?

839
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.080
放松  好的
Relax. Okay...

840
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.210
♪ Needless to say, I... ♪

841
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.250
还有这种操作
Oh, for crying out loud.

842
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.020
♪ Callin' it quits
Now, baby, I'm a wreck ♪

843
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.390
♪ You're a wreck, ooh... ♪

844
00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.100
小屁孩  果然不靠谱
Teenagers, just the worst

845
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:02.990
迈尔斯  你去哪儿了?
Miles? Where did you go?

846
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.730
我就在这儿
I'm right here.

847
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.950
在哪儿? 我看不到你
Where? I can't see you.

848
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:08.850
我就在你面前  蜘蛛侠能隐身吗?
I'm right in front of you. Can Spider-Man turn invisible?

849
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:09.710
在我们那儿不行
Not in my universe.

850
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.610
啊  你戳到我眼睛了
Ow! You just poked me in my eye!

851
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.380
真是不可思议  像是打不过就闪的本能
This is incredible some kind of fight or flight thing.

852
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.310
什么意思?
What's that?

853
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.650
把密码记下来  D-g-f-a-m-p-e-s-a-n-d
Remember this password: Dgfampesand

854
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.650
慢点  彼得
Slow down, Peter!

855
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.090
-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

856
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.300
我得写下来
I need to write it down!

857
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.250
接着下载设计图纸
and download the schematic

858
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:27.800
我要怎么做?
How do I do that?!

859
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.800
然后看我使出美男计
While I turn on the charm.

860
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:33.200
蜘蛛侠?
Spider-Man?

861
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.800
嘿  刚才没看到你
Oh, hey. Didn't see you there...

862
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.370
好吧  我有点被吓着了
Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now.

863
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:41.200
我是说  你应该死了才对
I mean, You're supposed to be dead.

864
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:44.510
没想到吧  好吧  这样可不行  我不习惯
Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no. We don't like that.

865
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.280
真是太神奇了
This is fascinating.

866
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.040
好吧  那是我的脸
Okay, that's my face.

867
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.280
一个完全不同的彼得·帕克
An entirely different Peter Parker.

868
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.110
好吧  有点小肚腩  可能是因为空间扭曲
OK, a little bit of a gut, perhaps from dimensional warping.

869
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.650
对  对  对  穿越前我比现在瘦多了
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I was way flatter before I warped.

870
00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.100
穿越时空似乎会造成细胞恶化
Travel through the multiverse appears to have deteriorated...

871
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.590
接下去是什么?
Ah what was the rest?!

872
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:07.200
你多大了? 你看上去不超过35岁
How old are you? You don't look a day over 35!

873
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.800
他们说我疯了！他们说我疯了！
They said I was crazy! They said I was crazy!

874
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.700
你给他们看看你没疯
You showed 'em you're not crazy.

875
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.440
这可能会有点疼
This might pinch a little.

876
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.410
我知道  我只需要取一些样本
I know, I just need to get these samples.

877
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:19.640
好吧
Yeah, ok.

878
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.440
就不能整理下桌面吗  女士
Organize your desktop, lady!

879
00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:24.420
哇  体内的细胞正在发生衰变
Wow. Just complete cellular decay.

880
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.380
我从来没见过这种情况
I've never seen anything like this.

881
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.620
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

882
00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.550
把数据连窝端走
I'm just taking the whole thing.

883
00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.350
很明显  你出故障了
And obviously you've been glitching.

884
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.490
故障? 不  为什么这么说?
Glitching? No. Why would you even say that?

885
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.430
你在这个空间待太久了
If you stay in this dimension too long,

886
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.090
你的身体正在瓦解
your body's gonna disintegrate.

887
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:41.100
知道这会有多疼吗? 彼得·帕克
Do you know how painful that would be, Peter Parker?

888
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.100
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

889
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.200
你根本想象不到
You can't imagine.

890
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.550
而我迫不及待想要见证那一刻
And I, for one, can't wait to watch.

891
00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.540
你叫什么名字来着?
What did you say your name was?

892
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.410
奥利维亚·奥克塔维厄斯博士
Doctor Olivia Octavius.

893
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.890
我猜你的朋友是不是都叫你章鱼博士?
Can I assume that your friends call you Doc Ock?

894
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.320
我朋友都叫我丽芙
My friends actually call me Liv.

895
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.760
我的敌人才叫我章鱼博士
My enemies call me Doc Ock.

896
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.330
这儿交给我  快跑
I got this! Run!

897
00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.390
你在和谁说话?
Who are you talking to?

898
00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.350
我能搞定
I got it!

899
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.350
你搞得定吗? 彼得
Oh, you got it Peter?

900
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:20.710
我稳得住  伙计
I got it handled buddy!

901
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.210
一切尽在掌握之中
Everything is fine!

902
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.340
好吧  情况有点失控
Okay this is a little bit bad.

903
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:30.350
你废话还真多
Oh, you're chatty!

904
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:31.220
快走
Gotta go.

905
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.520
我想我快坚持不住了
And this is the moment that I'm losing the fight.

906
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.720
好吧  告诉你个好消息  我们不需要显示器
Alright, let me tell you the good news. We don't need the monitor.

907
00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:44.230
彼得
Peter!

908
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:47.900
你怎么没告诉我  你还有个会隐身的朋友
You didn't tell me you had an invisible friend!

909
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.830
把电脑给我好吗? 年轻人
Could you give me that back, young man?

910
00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:51.830
彼得
Peter!

911
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.270
这是私人财产
It's proprietary.

912
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.650
这种情况还是隐身比较好
Wow. This'd be a good time to turn invisible.

913
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:03.410
没错
- Yep.

914
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.800
好吧  那你怎么还不隐身
Ok, not going to turn invisible.

915
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.180
挑一个面包圈  表现得自然一点
Selecting a bagel... act super normal...

916
00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.450
蜘蛛侠?
Spider-Man?

917
00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:11.650
说来你也不信  很多人都会认错
You know it's funny I get that a lot.

918
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.350
嘿
- Hey.

919
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:12.900
蜘蛛侠?
Spider-Man?

920
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.590
嘿  举起手来
Hey! Hands Up!

921
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:15.890
好了  交换一下
Now we do a switchy-switchy.

922
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:16.500
什么?
What?

923
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.500
给我回来  你们想去哪里? 他偷了面包圈
Get back here! Where do you think you're going? He took a bagel!

924
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.300
好了  准备好荡起来  就像我教你的那样
Alright time to swing, just like I taught you!

925
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.900
你什么时候教过我?
When did you teach me that?

926
00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.500
也对  我只是开个玩笑  增进感情
I didn't! It's a little joke for team building!

927
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.270
嘿  嘿  嘿
Hey! Hey! Hey!

928
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.150
准备好了吗?
Alright, you ready?

929
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:29.500
当然没有
Of course I'm not ready!

930
00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.710
我还做不到
Whoa, whoa, I can't do this yet!

931
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:34.780
大家都知道  一个人在生死关头
Everybody knows that the best way to learn

932
00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.950
可以做到许多本来做不到的事
is under intense life-threatening pressure.

933
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:41.790
拜托  拜托
C'mon, c'mon!

934
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.290
哦  不好
Uh oh.

935
00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.660
你在下面做什么?
What are you doing down there?!

936
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.570
我跑得比荡得快
I run better than I swing!

937
00:52:56.570 --> 00:53:01.150
你得荡起来  不然他们会抓住你的  这就是你想学的
You gotta swing or they'll catch you! This is what you wanted!

938
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:08.910
哦  不
Uh-oh.

939
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.520
快回来  小家伙
Come back, little boy!

940
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.890
以胯部为准线  瞄准目标位置
Aim with your hips! Look where you want it to hit.

941
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:21.360
肩膀放平  别忘了后续动作
Square your shoulders. Don't forget to follow through!

942
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.820
重心在后脚时不要发射
Don't shoot off your back foot.

943
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:23.900
太多了记不住
That's too many things!

944
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.530
那就别管我说的
Then stop listening to me!

945
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.600
这是你今天给的最有用的建议
That's the best idea you've had all day!

946
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.210
漂亮  迈尔斯
Nice Miles!

947
00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.990
我做到了
I'm doing it!

948
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.900
很好  你做到了  轻按两下松开  然后再发射一次
Good, you're doing it! Double tap to release and thwip it out again.

949
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.400
懂了
Okay.

950
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.400
发射  然后松开  发射  松开
Thwip. And release. And thwip. Release.

951
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.000
发射  然后松开
Thwip. And release.

952
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.600
悟性不错
You're a natural.

953
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.850
发射  松开  找到节奏了吗?
Thwip. Release. Feel the rhythm?

954
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.560
再松开
Woohoo! And release.

955
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.760
很不错  迈尔斯
Good, Miles!

956
00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.860
我想说  你超酷的  伙计
I gotta say, you're amazing man!

957
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.400
我们是团队了
We're a little team!

958
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.360
我是当年实力不减的老师
Me as the teacher who could still do it.

959
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.400
你资质不错  但和我当年比还差点
You as the student who can do it, just not as good.

960
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.240
真为我们骄傲  你有什么想对我说的吗?
I'm proud of us. Is there something you want to say to me?

961
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:11.340
彼得
Peter!

962
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:24.880
搞什么?
What the...

963
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.200
谁干的?
Who did that?

964
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.450
嘿  伙计们
Hey guys.

965
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:54.580
格温达?
Gwanda?

966
00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:56.380
是格温才对
It's Gwen, actually.

967
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:59.360
你认识她? 真是不错
Oh, you know her? Very cool.

968
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.120
我来自另一个时空
I'm from another dimension.

969
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.360
我是说  除了另一个还有一个
I mean, another-another dimension.

970
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.000
好吧  各位  我们再从头来一次
All right, people. Let's start at the beginning one last time.

《蜘蛛侠格温》
好吧  各位  我们再从头来一次
All right, people. Let's start at the beginning one last time.

972
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:07.030
好吧  各位  我们再从头来一次
All right, people. Let's start at the beginning one last time.

973
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:08.760
我叫做格温·史黛西
My name is Gwen Stacy.

974
00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:11.600
我被一只受过辐射的蜘蛛咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

975
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.400
在接下来的两年里
And for the last two years,

976
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.670
我成为了唯一的女蜘蛛侠
I've been the one and only Spider-Woman.

977
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.610
剩下的你们都知道了
You guys know the rest.

978
00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.080
我加入了乐队
I joined a band.

979
00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.580
救了我爸爸
Saved my dad.

980
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.380
可我却没能救下我最好的朋友
I couldn't save my best friend,

981
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:30.850
彼得·帕克
Peter Parker,

982
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.760
所以我发誓要救其他人
so now I save everyone else.

983
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.690
于是我决定再也不交朋友了
And I don't do friends anymore,

984
00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:39.330
避免一切干扰
just to avoid any distractions.

985
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:45.030
突然有一天  奇怪的事发生了
And one day this weird thing happened.

986
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.110
这次的情况真的很奇怪
...and I mean, like, really weird.

987
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:56.380
我穿越到了上个星期
I was blown into last week.

988
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:05.550
一点都不夸张  我回到了纽约  可不是我的纽约
Literally. I landed in New York. But not my New York.

989
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:06.860
这是本月三州地区发生的第二次地震
...this is the second earthquake in the Tri-State area this month.

990
00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.520
幸运的是
Lucky for these folks,

991
00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.790
蜘蛛侠出现了
Spider-Man was there to save the day.

992
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.960
我的蜘蛛直觉告诉我得去愿景学校
My Spider-sense told me to head to Visions Academy.

993
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.960
是你们早到了
you guys are early.

994
00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:19.000
我也不知道为什么  直到遇上了你
I wasn't sure why until I met you

995
00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.170
我喜欢你的发型
I like your haircut.

996
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.070
你还好意思说
You don't get to like my haircut

997
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.570
我们走
Let's go.

998
00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:26.910
到底有多少蜘蛛侠?
How many more spider people are there?

999
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:28.080
自己去动漫展上看吧
Save it for comic-con!

1000
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.180
动漫展是什么?
What's Comic-Con?

1001
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:48.730
受死吧  蜘蛛侠
You're dead Spider-Man.

1002
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.930
威尔逊  你在做什么?
Wilson, what are you doing?

1003
00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.100
瓦内莎
Vanessa.

1004
00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.470
理查德  快走
Richard, c'mon...

1005
00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.850
瓦内莎  理查德  不
Vanessa! Richard! No!

1006
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.110
别往后看  亲爱的  没事的  没事的
Don't look back honey. It's okay. It's okay.

1007
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.900
我明明杀了蜘蛛侠
I killed Spider-Man.

1008
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.970
为什么又多出来两个?
Why did I just see two more?

1009
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:28.240
准确说是三个
There's three, actually.

1010
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.270
不  这是好事  非常非常好
No, this is good. This is very, very good.

1011
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.970
这意味着你的目的达到了
This means you get what you want.

1012
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.140
我的对撞机起作用了
It means my collider works.

1013
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:39.610
现在我们要做的就是  灭掉那几只蜘蛛
All we have to do is kill a couple of Spiders.

1014
00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.280
然后你的家人就能回到你的身边
And the collider will bring your family back.

1015
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:44.890
想要多少就有多少
As many families as you want.

1016
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.830
明天启动我的对撞机
Tomorrow at my collider.

1017
00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:58.900
是我们的对撞机
Our collider.

1018
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:03.670
是他弄坏的吗?
He broke this?

1019
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:06.210
对  他也觉得很不好意思
Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed about it,

1020
00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:08.310
所以就当没这事好吗?
so just keep it between us, okay?

1021
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:11.550
我知道哪里能做个新的
I know where we can make a new one.

1022
00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:13.750
这次不会再让他弄坏了
And we won't let him break it this time.

1023
00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:17.960
你朋友的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about your friend.

1024
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.860
谢谢你  迈尔斯
Thanks, Miles.

1025
00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:24.890
我知道这有多艰难
I know how hard this is.

1026
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.600
要一个人面对这一切
To have to figure this stuff out on your own.

1027
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.770
知道自己不是一个人感觉还不错
It's kinda nice not being the only Spider-person around.

1028
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.170
是啊
Yeah.

1029
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.000
如果哪天你愿意交朋友了
If you ever decide to do friends again,

1030
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:37.740
我可以给你留个位置
I could always open up a slot.

1031
00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.910
到时候我会告诉你的
I'll keep you posted.

1032
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:43.950
好的
Cool.

1033
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:50.590
不如我们还是走吧
We should probably go.

1034
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.920
彼得  都已经到门口了
Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.

1035
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.820
太糟了  太糟了  这主意太糟了
Bad idea, bad idea, this is a bad idea.

1036
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:56.360
放轻松
Just relax.

1037
00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.160
感谢你们的关心
You guys are all very sweet,

1038
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.630
但今天不接待粉丝了  谢谢
but no more fans today, please.

1039
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.630
我还没做好心理准备
I'm not ready for this.

1040
00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:11.880
彼得
Peter...

1041
00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.740
嘿  梅婶婶
Hey, Aunt May.

1042
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:17.780
我知道这听起来有些疯狂
So this is gonna sound crazy,

1043
00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.250
不过  我其实是来自
but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an...

1044
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.250
另一个时空
an alternate dimension.

1045
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:23.550
没错
Yeah.

1046
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.920
你看起来很累  彼得
You look tired, Peter.

1047
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.120
好吧  我确实很累
Well, I am tired.

1048
00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:31.550
有点苍老  而且还丰满了
And older. And... thicker.

1049
00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.600
对  已经有人说过了
Yeah, I've heard that already.

1050
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.830
天啊  这个是宽松裤吗?
Oh jeez, are those sweatpants?

1051
00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:37.070
没错  就是宽松裤
Yup. That's what they are.

1052
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:38.970
彼得走的时候
I was there,

1053
00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:41.340
我就在现场
when it all happened.

1054
00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.400
我真的很抱歉
I am so sorry.

1055
00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:45.670
你又是从哪个空间来的?
And what dimension are you from?

1056
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.740
布鲁克林
Brooklyn.

1057
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:51.010
彼得有没有什么地方能让我们重做一下这个?
Did Peter have a place where we could make another one of these?

1058
00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:52.820
是个小玩意儿
A goober.

1059
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.280
跟我来
Follow me.

1060
00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.690
好吧  我也有这么个地方
Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too.

1061
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.960
存放装备的小屋子
A little, old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.

1062
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.340
这地方也太能装了
I mean, this place is pretentious.

1063
01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:32.750
伙计  你那儿也和这里一样吗?
Whoa. Dude, was yours anything like this?

1064
01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.060
差不多吧
Mine was like this,

1065
01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.120
不过没有吉普车和飞机
but take away the jeep, the plane.

1066
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:39.930
想象一下是这儿的缩小版  再多两个床垫
Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.

1067
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:42.300
现在的年轻人真是的
I feel sad for this guy.

1068
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.380
嘿  彼得
Hey, Peter.

1069
01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.880
这不是斗篷吗
I think this is a cape.

1070
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:20.440
彼得知道他的使命有多危险
Peter knew how dangerous the job was.

1071
01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.200
可他也知道这世上唯一能阻止那家伙的
But he figured the only one who could stop this guy

1072
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.940
只有蜘蛛侠
was Spider-Man.

1073
01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:28.380
金并知道我们会去找他
Kingpin knows we're coming.

1074
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.340
可惜我们寡不敌众
We're going to be outnumbered.

1075
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:32.750
那可不一定
Don't be so sure.

1076
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.790
你们可能会用到这个
You might need these.

1077
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:42.290
你们以为只有你们想到来这儿吗?
You think you're the only people who thought to come here?

1078
01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.290
嘿  伙计们
Hey fellas.

1079
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.000
他是黑白的吗?
Is he in black and white?

1080
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.400
哪里来的风? 这里可是地下室
Where is that wind coming from? We're in a basement.

1081
01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.200
不管到哪儿  冷风总是相随
Wherever I go, the wind follows.

1082
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.070
而这风  终将幻化成雨
And the wind, it smells like rain.

1083
01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.850
大家好  你们好吗? 很高兴认识你们
Hi guys! Konichiwa! Hajimemashita yoroshuku?

1084
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:04.780
敢不敢再诡异一点
This could literally not get any weirder.

1085
01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.550
还有更诡异的
It can get weirder.

1086
01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:10.860
我刚洗了手  所以它才是湿的
I just washed my hands. That's why they're wet.

1087

没别的原因

I'm from New York in the year 3145.

1105
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:44.590
我爸的机器人里住着一只蜘蛛
I have a psychic link with a spider

1106
01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:46.390
我和它有心灵感应
who lives inside my father's robot.

1107
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:49.020
我们是一辈子的好朋友

1108
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:51.090
有时我会让火柴一直燃烧到指尖
Sometimes I let matches burn down to my fingertips

1109
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:52.460
只是为了能有点感觉

When I'm not pooching around, I'm working like a dog,

1112
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.840
到处挖掘劲爆新闻
trying to sniff out the latest story.

1113
01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.970
我唱歌跳舞
♪ I frolic and I dance ♪

1114
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:02.000
边跳边扭屁股

1115
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.610
好了  可以了

1116
01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:06.880
那么  你们是怎么来的?
So, uh, how did you get here?

1117
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.050
好吧  这可就说来话长了
Well, it's kind of a long story.

1118
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.350
或许也没那么长
Maybe not that long.

1119
01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:18.450
现在我们只想回家
And now we're just trying to find a way home.

1120
01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:23.020
回家的唯一方法就是跳进那个对撞机
The only way home is back through that collider gizmo.

1121
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.360
唯一的问题就是
The only trouble is...

1122
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.600
得有个人留下来毁了那机器
One of us has to stay behind and destroy it.

1123
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.030
我留下来
- I'll do it. - I'll do it.- I'll do it.

1124
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:31.430

No, no, no, you don't get it.

1125

不明白什么?
Don't get what

1126
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.280
你们不能留在这儿  如果留在这儿  你们会死的
None of you can stay here. If you stay here, you'll die.

1127
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.510
应该由我来关掉那机器
I'm the guy who's gonna turn it off.

1128
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:47.350
我会等你们都回去之后再动手
And I'm gonna get you all home before I do.

1129
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:51.390
我答应过他的  所以我必须做到
Look, I made a promise. So I have to keep it.

这小子会隐身术  看好了  他现在就能隐形
This kid can turn himself invisible! Watch this, he can do it... now!

1135
01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.950
我不能说隐就隐
I can't do it on command

1136

但他还有其他技能  比如什么来这?
But he can do so much more. What else do you do?

1141
01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:21.850
只有这两样
Just those two things

1142
01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:23.200
只有这两样
Just those two things.

1143
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.450
伙计
Oh, man.

你能一次性搞定他们吗?
Can you fight them all off at once?

1150
01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:45.240
其实我还没和别人交过手

1237
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.750
你可闯大祸了  小子  太粗心了
You messed up big time kid. Very sloppy.

1238
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.750
看看这些可怜的小蜘蛛
Mira todas estas arañitas.

1239
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:08.090
让我猜猜  你是蝎子? 我们是蜘蛛  算是远亲
Let me guess, you're Scorpion? Well, we're the, uh... Spider-gang

1240
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:10.360
你们介不介意到外面解决?
Would you mind taking this outside?

1241
01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.390
我们跳起舞来从不挑场子
We don't pick the ballroom we just dance.

1242
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.200
那个就交给我吧
Oh, I think I'll be taking that.

1243
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.810
小家伙  来吧  准备受死吧
Stand, niñito, dale. Prepárate a morir.

1248
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.750

Leave the kid alone!

快离开  伙计
You gotta go, man.

1251
01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.940
所有车辆请注意  发生骚乱事件
All vehicles in the area, we have a disturbance

1252
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.510
嫌疑人为蜘蛛们
involving multiple spider... people?

1253
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:33.780
是的  这就去
Yeah, on my way!

1254
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:45.020
把它交给我
Give me that thing!

1255
01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.360
别傻了  小子  快交给我
Don't be stupid, kid. Hand it over, now

1256
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.710
你无路可逃了
Nowhere left to run.

1263
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.900
快离开这儿
Get out of here!

不
No.

艾伦叔叔  这都是我的错
...Uncle Aaron. This is my fault.

1267
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:40.170
不  迈尔斯
No, Miles.

1268
01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.170
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1269
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:48.010
是我骗了你  我想你崇拜我
I wanted you to look up to me.

1270
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:52.620
是我让你失望了
I let you down, man. I let you down.

You're the best of all of us, Miles.

你有属于自己的路
You're on your way.

你要坚持下去

Turn around.

Look, it was my fault. You wouldn't understand.

对  确实不妙

这都是我们教他的对吧?
Ah we taught him that right?

1487
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.830
我可没教过他  更不可能是你教的
I didn't teach him that. And you definitely didn't.

1488
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.110

1500
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.630

可以放在口袋里
It'll fit in your pocket.

1503
01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.310
朋友们  就到这儿吧

他可以这么说吗? 不侵权吗?

15 months, but it's pretty significant if you ask me.

1508
01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:32.260
好吧  爱因斯坦说过时间是相对的  不是吗?
Well, Einstein said time was relative, right?

1509
01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:35.030
聪明
Nice.

1510
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:39.030
朋友?
Friends?

1511
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:41.970
朋友
Friends.

1512
01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:43.040
真棒
Cool.

1513
01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.070
回头见  蜘蛛侠
See you around Spider-Man.

1514
01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.120
该你了
Your turn.

1515
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:01.090
对  是的
Yeah yeah right...

1516
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.890
你哪都别想去
You're not going anywhere!

1517
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:09.360
我去拖住他  你把机器关掉
I'll hold him off, you shut this down!

1518
01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.060
彼得  计划不是这样的
Peter, that wasn't the deal!

1519
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:14.340
按绿色的按钮  千万不要等我
Push the green button! Do not wait for me!

1520
01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:19.150
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1521
01:35:19.150 --> 01:35:20.540
彼得  你必须回家
Peter, you gotta go home!

1522
01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.510
这家伙会杀了你的
This guy could kill you! I can't let Spider-Man die.

1523
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:25.250
我也不能
Neither can I.

1524
01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.880
不会有事的
It's OK.

1525
01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:31.250
对  不会有事的
Yeah, it is ok.

1526
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.960
你得回家  伙计
You gotta go home man.

1527
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:42.160
我怎么知道这次会不会再被我搞砸了?
How do I know I'm not gonna mess it up again?

1528
01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.360
你不会知道
You won't.

1529
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:46.330
对
Right.

1530
01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:48.270
这是种信念
It's a leap of faith.

1531
01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:59.380
真不赖  小子
Not bad, kid.

1532
01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:09.860
金并
Kingpin!

1533
01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.600
不
Nope!

1534
01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:26.840
抱歉  那是作弊
Sorry! That's cheating.

1535
01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:30.110
再见了
Adios!

1536
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:40.460
我得到按钮那儿去
I gotta get to that button.

1537
01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:46.960
不
Oh no...

1538
01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.300
孤军奋战没想象中那么容易吧?
Not so easy doing it on your own is it?

1539
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:55.570
我迫不及待地想再杀一个蜘蛛侠
I can't wait to kill one more Spider-Man.

1540
01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.000
你在干什么? 我在哪里?
What are you doing? Where am I?

1541
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.010
什么
What...

1542
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:02.610
威尔逊
Wilson...

1543
01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:03.900
这就是你想要的吗?
Is this what you want man?

1544
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.200
你在做什么? 离我们远点
What are you doing? You stay away from us.

1545
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.080
瓦内莎? 瓦内莎  理查德
Vanessa? Vanessa! Richard!

1546
01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.450
我们怎么会在这儿?
What're we doing here?

1547
01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:10.590
我不知道  理查德
I don't know Richard...

1548
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:11.890
瓦内莎  是我  你知道我的
Vanessa it's me. You know me!

1549
01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.590
快离开这儿
...we're leaving now.

1550
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:16.920
别走
Don't go!

1551
01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:18.390
留下来
Stay with me.

1552
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:20.130
求你了
Please!

1553
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:28.270
我不会让你阻止我的  这次绝对不行
You're not stopping this. Not today.

1554
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:30.910
我就要阻止你  就现在
I am stopping this! Right now!

1555
01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.320
我需要支援
I need back up!

1556
01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:20.220
拜托
Come on.

1557
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:35.250
真正的蜘蛛侠都战胜不了我  你算什么
The real Spider-Man couldn't even beat me. You're nothing!

1558
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:43.550
你夺走了我的家人
You took my family.

1559
01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:51.490
现在我要让你也见不到你的家人
And now I'm gonna make sure you never see yours again.

1560
01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:13.010
站起来  蜘蛛侠
Get up, Spider-Man!

1561
01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.980
站起来  快点
Get up! C'mon... C'mon.

1562
01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.060
拜托  拜托  拜托
C'mon... c'mon... come on...

1563
01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.370
我不会离开我的家人
I'll always have my family.

1564
01:39:42.370 --> 01:39:44.110
听过搭肩膀这招吗?
You ever hear of the shoulder touch?

1565
01:39:45.210 --> 01:39:46.310
什么?
What?

1566
01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.640
嘿
“Hey.”

1567
01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:05.430
嘿  金并  帮我按下绿色按钮
Hey Kingpin! Push the green button for me!

1568
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.400
迈尔斯?  迈尔斯?  迈尔斯  你没事吧?
Miles? Miles? Miles?! Are you ok?

1569
01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:58.510
放心 我没事
Yeah, I'm ok.

1570
01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:00.740
你现在应该很忙  所以
You're probably busy so...

1571
01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.780
不  不  不  我有空  我有空
No no no no, I can talk! I can talk.

1572
01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:06.650
我之前去找你是因为
Look, so I came by earlier because...

1573
01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:10.320
你叔叔  -我知道  爸爸
- Your uncle... - I know, Dad.

1574
01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.190
我很难过
I am so sorry.

1575
01:42:13.190 --> 01:42:15.250
我懂
Yeah.

1576
01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.720
知道是谁干的吗?
Do you know who did it?

1577
01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:20.650
我以为知道  可我错了
I thought I did. But I was wrong.

1578
01:42:20.690 --> 01:42:24.260
听着  迈尔斯  我在门口说的那些
Look, Miles, what I said at the door,

1579
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:25.630
不只是说说而已
it wasn't just talk.

1580
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:29.700
听着  知道吗  我在想我们可以
Look, you know, I was thinking

1581
01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:32.410
找一堵不错的墙
maybe we could find a nice wall,

1582
01:42:32.410 --> 01:42:33.150
私人所有的
privately owned,

1583
01:42:33.150 --> 01:42:33.990
好的  爸爸
Ok, dad.

1584
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:35.540
比如警察局那堵墙
like at the police station

1585
01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:41.750
这样你就可以把你的作品“丢到”墙上去了
and you could "throw up" some of your art.

1586
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:44.280
我实在不擅长说这些
Man, I'm bad at this.

1587
01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:47.420
好吧  迈尔斯  迈尔斯?  你还在吗?
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1588
01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:50.360
真是的  什么破信号
C'mon man, C-Mobile

1589
01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:50.990
警官?
Officer?

1590
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:57.300
蜘蛛侠  我想说  刚才真是  我是说我欠你一个
Spider-Man. Listen, down there, that was, I mean I owe you

1591
01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.500
好吧
Okay!

1592
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:09.370
很期待和你并肩作战
I look forward to working with you.

1593
01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:11.810
对  我想也是
Yeah, me too, I guess.

1594
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:14.980
虽然我不赞同你的方式
I don't approve of your methods,

1595
01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:18.450
不过想法不错也许也能擦出火花
but we're just gonna have to agree to disagree.

1596
01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:21.420
感谢你今晚的英勇行为
Thank you for your bravery tonight.

1597
01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:22.660
我爱你
I love you.

1598
01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:24.260
等等  什么?
Wait, what?

1599
01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.390
看看你身后
And look behind you!

1600
01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.350
你友好的邻居蜘蛛侠献上

1601
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:38.570
没错  是很酷  对
Alright. Cool, yeah!

1602
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:39.970
谢谢你  蜘蛛侠
Yeah, thanks Spider-Man!

1603
01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:41.450
我是蜘蛛侠  谢谢
Yeah I'm Spider-man! A su servicio! Thank you.

1604
01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:42.900
你就是蜘蛛侠啊
Yeah, you the Spider-Man!

1605
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.440
嘿  小家伙怎么了?
Hey, man. What's up, little man?

1606
01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.640
新蜘蛛侠
New Spider-Man.

1607
01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:45.910
对  没错  我是新蜘蛛侠
Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man.

1608
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:47.480
看好了
Check it out.

1609
01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.480
刚才那是设计好的
Whoa! That was part of the move.

1610
01:43:51.490 --> 01:43:54.550
好了  我们最后再来一次
Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah?

1611
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.050
这次是真的最后一次
For real this time. This is it.

1612
01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.720
我叫做迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯
My name is Miles Morales.

1613
01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.830
我被一只受过辐射的蜘蛛咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

1614
01:43:59.830 --> 01:44:01.460
于是就在最近
And for like two days,

1615
01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:03.460
我成了这里唯一的蜘蛛侠
I've been the one and only Spider-Man.

1616
01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.960
剩下的你们都知道了
I think you know the rest.

1617
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:05.700
我写完了论文
I finished my essay.

1618
01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.350
远大前程
我写完了论文
I finished my essay.

1619
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.430
我写完了论文
I finished my essay.

1620
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:09.570
救了不少人
Saved a bunch of people.

1621
01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.940
撞到过无人机
Got hit by a drone.

1622
01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.640
我和我爸完成了这个
I did this with my dad.

1623
01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.890
艾伦叔叔
力量永存

1624
01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:18.250
最后来见见我的室友
Met my roommate finally.

1625
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:19.230
好兄弟

1626
01:44:20.010 --> 01:44:23.380
在我爸爸永远找不到的地方贴贴纸
Slapped a sticker where my Dad's never going to find it.

1627
01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.050
当我感到孤单
And when I feel alone,

1628
01:44:25.050 --> 01:44:27.720
感觉没人能理解自己时
like no one understands what I'm going through,

1629
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.360
我知道我的朋友们会懂我
I remember my friends who get it.

1630
01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:40.530
我从没想过自己能够做到这些
I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff.

1631
01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:42.040
可我做到了
But I can.

1632
01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:45.540
任何人都能戴上这个面具
Anyone can wear the mask.

1633
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:49.040
你也可以
You could wear the mask.

1634
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:53.980
如果以前你没想过  希望现在可以
If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now.

1635
01:45:02.690 --> 01:45:03.790
因为我是蜘蛛侠
'Cause I'm Spider-Man.

1636
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:08.560
但我不是唯一的
And I'm not the only one.

1637
01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.100
绝对不是

- It's just a prototype. - Not excited.

1884
01:55:55.210 --> 01:55:56.470
你可能是第一个
But you could be the first person

1885
01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.440
进入自主平行宇宙跳跃的人
to make an autonomous multiverse jump.

1886
01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.750
或许是最后一个
Or the last.

1887
01:55:59.750 --> 01:56:01.580
那么我们就在这孤注一掷了吗？
So we're just gonna roll the dice on this?

1888
01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:04.450
你觉得怎么样？ 伙计  想先去哪里？
So, what you do you say, pal? Where you want to go first?

1889
01:56:04.450 --> 01:56:07.390

Earth '67.

1891
01:56:12.130 --> 01:56:13.690
什么？
Whoa... what the...

1892
01:56:13.690 --> 01:56:15.880
我是蜘蛛侠  你要跟我走
I’m Spider-man. I need you to come with me.

1893
01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:16.700
你到底是谁？
Who the heck are you?

1894
01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:19.230
我刚刚告诉过你  听着  我来自未来
I just told you that, listen, listen. I'm from the future.

1895
01:56:19.230 --> 01:56:20.600
你竟敢指着我
How dare you point at me!

1896
01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.500
是你先指着我的
You were pointing first!

1897
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.040
对别人指指点点很不礼貌  你太不礼貌了
- It's rude to point. - You're being very rude.

1898
01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.070
哪个先指的？
Which one pointed first?

1899
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:28.040
很明显是蜘蛛侠先指的
Spider-man pointed first! Obviously!

1900
01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.740
你这么说就是在指我  我没有在指谁
- You're pointing at me right now. - I'm not pointing.

1901
01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:31.480
看看你的手指
Look at your finger.

1902
01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:32.780
我指的和你指的是不同的
I'm pointing out your pointing, which is different.

1903
01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:34.410
你没见到在指谁
You haven't seen pointing.

1904
01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.520
你在指着我
You're accusing me of pointing while you're...!

1905
01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:39.950
剧终
