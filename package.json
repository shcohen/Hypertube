  "description": "This project's goal is to create a web application that allows the user to research and watch videos. The player is directly integrated to the website and the videos are downloaded through the BitTorrent protocol. Once the element is selected, it is downloaded from the server and streamed on the web player at the same time ; which means that the player isn't only showing the video once the download is completed, but is able to stream directly into to video feed.",
