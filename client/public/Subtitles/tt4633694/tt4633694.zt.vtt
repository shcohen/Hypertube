好吧 各位 我們最後再來一次

我叫彼得 帕克
My name is Peter Parker.

5

我被一隻受過輻射的蜘蛛咬了

在過去的10年裏

11
00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.793
能力越大 責任就越大
With great power comes great responsibility.

12
00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:41.234
拯救了不少人  墜入過愛河  拯救過城市
I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city.

13
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.201
又一次的拯救城市
And then I saved the city again.

14
00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.335
一次又一次
And again and again

15
00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:46.636

21
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.380
看我還出過漫畫 還有同款麥片食物

經歷過這些事後
But after everything...

28
00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.228
我仍然喜歡做蜘蛛俠
I still love being Spider-Man.

29
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.596
我是說誰不喜歡呢
I mean, who wouldn't?

30
00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:15.667
不管被打敗多少次
So no matter how many hits I take...

31
00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:21.672
我最終總是會爬起來的

因為能平衡這個城市的

認真的嗎 爸 我走去學校就好了
Seriously, Dad. Walking would've been fine.

據知情者瞭解 蜘蛛俠正在調查這件事
Sources close to Spider-Man say he's looking into the problem.

86
00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.954
蜘蛛俠 一個帶著小面具到處
Spider-Man. I mean, this guy swings in once a day,

87
00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:54.390
蕩來蕩去 我行我素的人 對吧

92
00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.468
能力越大  責任越大
With great ability comes great accountability.

93
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.069
這句話可不是這麼說的
That's not even how the saying goes.

94
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.605
不過我確實喜歡他的麥片  我會告訴他的
I do like his cereal, though. I'll give him that.

You've given it two weeks.

102

我們完全不用討論這些的
We're not having this conversation.

103
00:05:29.894 --> 00:05:32.094
我只是覺得這所新學校是精英學校
I just think that this new school is elitist.

104
00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:33.697

我之所以能在這裏是因為我撞了大運
I'm only here 'cause I won that stupid lottery.

No way. You passed the entry test just like everybody else.

00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:12.161
五頁紙的論文 結論是重點
Five-page essay with your conclusions stressed.

141
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:22.772
會有無數種可能性
...countless other possibilities.

142
00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:25.108
在另一個宇宙我可能穿的是紅衣服
There could be a universe where I am wearing red.

143
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.711
又或者是皮褲子
Or wearing leather pants.

144
00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:31.046
偷偷溜進來的莫拉萊斯先生  你又遲到了
Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark. You're late again.

145
00:07:31.048 --> 00:07:33.617
愛因斯坦說過時間是相對的  不是嗎
Einstein said time was relative, right?

146
00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:37.790
或許我沒有遲到 也許只是你們早到了
Maybe I'm not late. Maybe you guys are early.

147
00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:43.793
抱歉我只是覺得太安靜了
Sorry. It was just so quiet.

148
00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:46.096
你是想繼續站著呢
Would you like to keep standing there,

149
00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.163
還是坐下
or do you wanna sit down?

150
00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:53.069
我們所處的宇宙  其實是多個平行宇宙中的一個
Our universe is, in fact, one of many parallel universes

151
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:55.137
這些平行宇宙是同時存在的
happening at the exact same time.

152
00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:57.940
多虧了菲斯克家族科研基因會的所有人
Thanks to everyone here at the Fisk Family Foundation...

153
00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:00.142
-我喜歡你的笑話 -真的嗎
- I liked your joke. - Really?

154
00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:03.546
其實不好笑 所以我才會笑
I mean, it wasn't funny. That's why I laughed.

155
00:08:03.548 --> 00:08:05.781
不過想法不錯  所以我喜歡
But it was smart, so I liked it.

156
00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:07.317
我好像之前沒見過你
I don't think

157
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.019
我以前見過你
I've seen you before.

158
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.719
我以前見過你
Every choice that we make

159
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:14.024
都會創造出各種可能性
would create countless other possibilities.

160
00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:16.562
而這些可能性是無窮的
A what-if to infinity.

161
00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:20.130
零蛋  在多拿幾個零分
A zero? A few more of those,

162
00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.701
你應該就會把我踢出去了吧
you'd probably have to kick me outta here, huh?

163
00:08:24.168 --> 00:08:26.069
或許我不適合這個學校
Maybe I'm just not right for this school.

164
00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:28.171
如果一個人閉著眼睛
If a person wearing a blindfold picked the answers

165
00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:29.973
在一堆判斷題裏隨便亂選
on a true-or-false quiz at random,

166
00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:31.875
你猜準確率是多少
do you know what score they would get?

167
00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.776
-百分之五十 -回答正確
- 50%? - That's right!

168
00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:35.911
能正確避開所有正確答案
The only way to get all the answers wrong

169
00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:38.214
那就證明你其實全都會
is to know which answers are right.

170
00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:40.849
你故意想被開除
You're trying to quit.

171
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:43.320
我是不會答應的
And I'm not gonna let you.

172
00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.623
我要罰你寫篇關於自己的文章
I'm assigning you a personal essay.

173
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:49.325
不是關於物理  而是關於你自己的
Not about physics, but about you,

174
00:08:49.327 --> 00:08:51.994
你想成為 什麼樣的人
and what kind of person you want to be.

艾倫叔叔  嘿 嚇一跳吧
Uncle Aaron! Hey! Were you scared?

185
00:09:35.072 --> 00:09:38.074

You can't tell me it's all that bad there.

189
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:45.281
聰明的姑娘總是那麼迷人
Smart girls is where it's at.

190
00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:46.749

Place must be full of 'em.

191
00:09:49.187 --> 00:09:50.353
不  沒這回事  根本沒有
No, there's no one.

192

做我的侄子
Yo, I can't have no nephew of mine

193
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.390
可不能那麼沒戲
on the streets with no game.

194
00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.658
誰說我沒戲了 有個新來的姑娘
Hey, I got game. There's a new girl.

195
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.328
你懂的 他還挺喜歡我的
Actually, you know, she's kinda into me.

196
00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.396
你懂的
You know how it is.

197
00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.665
他叫什麼
What's her name?

198
00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.901
你懂的 我們還在建立感情階段
You know, we layin' down the groundwork right now.

199
00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:07.436
知道搭肩膀這招嗎
You know about the shoulder touch?

200
00:10:07.438 --> 00:10:09.339
當然知道
'Course I do.

201
00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.141
不過  說來聽聽
But tell me anyway.

202
00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.913
明天去找那姑娘 走到她面前  然後
Tomorrow, find that girl. You walk up to her and be like:

203
00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:18.882
嘿
"Hey."

204
00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.249
逗我呢嗎  艾倫叔叔
You serious, Uncle Aaron?

205
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:22.252
告訴你 這招很有技術含量的
I'm tellin' you, man, it's science.

206
00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:25.121
走到她面前  然後說 嘿
So walk up to her and be like: "Hey."

207
00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:28.223

No, no, no, no. Like: "Hey."

208
00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:29.392
嘿
"Hey."

209
00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:32.127
不 嘿
No. "Hey."

210
00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:33.762
嘿
"Hey."

211
00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:37.700
你真是我親侄子嗎
You sure you my nephew, man?

212
00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:39.201
是她嗎
Is that her?

213
00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:42.772
我該走了 還有一篇論文要寫
I should probably go. Still got a paper to do tonight.

214
00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:45.974

Yo, you been holdin' out on me? You throw these up yet?

215
00:10:45.976 --> 00:10:48.978

Naw, man. You know my dad. I can't.

216
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.180

I'm gonna get in so much trouble.

219
00:10:56.988 --> 00:11:00.890
別怕 告訴你爸是美術老師讓的
Hey, man. Tell him your art teacher made you.

220
00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:03.158

How'd you know about this place?

我想我發育了
I think I hit puberty.

262
00:14:20.424 --> 00:14:22.291
我得買新褲子了
I gotta get new pants.

263
00:14:22.293 --> 00:14:25.194
等等  為什麼我腦子裏的聲音這麼大
Wait. Why is the voice in my head so loud?

264
00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:26.130
怎麼回事
What?

265
00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:30.266
-你沒事吧 -什麼
- Oh! Are you okay? - What?

266
00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:31.968
我為什麼會出這麼多的汗
Why am I so sweaty?

267
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.603
你怎麼出那麼多的汗
Why are you so sweaty?

268
00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:35.939
因為我在發育
It's a puberty thing.

269
00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:38.708
我也不知道自己為什麼要這麼說  我沒有在發育
I don't know why I said that. I'm not going through puberty.

270
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.411
我是說  我已經成熟了
I did, but I'm done.

Yes, it's African. I'm South African.

278
00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:04.199
我從小在這兒長大  所以沒口音
No accent though 'cause I was raised here.

279
00:15:04.201 --> 00:15:07.605
快使出搭肩膀那招  趁她還沒走
Do the shoulder touch now before she walks away.

280
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:13.209
為什麼感覺這麼慌
Why is this so scary?

281
00:15:13.211 --> 00:15:17.280
是我在做慢動作  還是就是這種感覺
Am I doing this in slow motion or does it just feel that way?

282
00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:21.420
逗你的 我叫溫達 沒有格  開個玩笑
I'm kidding. It's Wanda. No "G." That's crazy. Heh.

283
00:15:23.321 --> 00:15:25.188
嘿
Hey.

284
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.522
好吧  那麼
Okay, then.

285
00:15:27.524 --> 00:15:28.724
我們回頭見
I'll see you around.

286
00:15:28.726 --> 00:15:32.060
回見
Oh. See you.

287
00:15:32.062 --> 00:15:34.033
-抱歉 -嘿
- Sorry. Um... - Hey.

288
00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:38.133
-怪了 -放開我好嗎
- Oh, crap. - Can you let go, please?

289
00:15:38.135 --> 00:15:40.673
-我做不到 -別亂動 沒關係
- I can't let go. - Ow! Ow! Calm down. It's fine.

290
00:15:43.173 --> 00:15:45.041
-邁爾斯 放開 -我也想
- Miles, let go. - Workin' on it.

291
00:15:45.043 --> 00:15:46.776
這都要怪青春期
It's just puberty.

292
00:15:46.778 --> 00:15:50.445
我想你對青春期的定義有什麼誤解吧  放輕鬆
I don't think you know what puberty is. Just relax.

293
00:15:50.447 --> 00:15:52.114
-好吧  我有個主意 -很好
- Okay, I have a plan. - Great.

294
00:15:52.116 --> 00:15:55.318
-我要使勁扯啦 -這是個愚蠢的主意
- I'm gonna pull really hard. - That's a terrible plan.

295
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.451
-一 -別那麼做
- One. - Don't do this.

296
00:15:56.453 --> 00:15:57.619
-二 -三
- Two. - Three!

297
00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.795
很高興認識你
Nice to meet you?

298
00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:09.999
很好 好到爆
Sure. Total pleasure.

299
00:16:14.672 --> 00:16:17.773
沒人看到 沒關係
No one saw. It's okay.

300
00:16:17.775 --> 00:16:20.675
沒人知道 沒人知道
No one knows, no one knows.

301
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.349
大家都知道了
Everyone knows.

302
00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:28.217
大家都知道了 他們在嘲笑我
Everyone knows. They're talkin' 'bout me.

303
00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:29.252
他們都看到了
They saw everything!

304
00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.054
他知道 她知道 他們都知道了
He knows. She knows. They know.

305
00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.488
她長的可真高
Wow, she's super tall.

306
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.556
他為什麼在笑 我現在成怪胎了嗎
Why is he smiling? Am I the weird guy now?

307
00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:35.557
我在幹嘛
What am I doing?

308
00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:36.758
那傢伙真是個怪胎
That guy's such a weirdo.

309
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.493
我怎麼停下來
How do I stop?

310
00:16:38.495 --> 00:16:40.329
他們能聽到我的心聲
Can they hear my thoughts?!

311
00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:43.098
我的心聲怎麼會那麼大聲
Why are all my thoughts so loud?!

312
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.767
嘿 我知道你昨晚溜出去了 莫拉萊斯
Hey! I know you snuck out last night, Morales.

313
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:47.335
裝傻
Play dumb!

314
00:16:47.337 --> 00:16:48.671
誰是莫拉萊斯
Who's Morales?

315
00:16:48.673 --> 00:16:50.540
也別那麼傻
Not that dumb!

316
00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:52.141
嘿
Hey!

317
00:16:58.682 --> 00:17:00.749
好了 好了 沒事了
Okay, okay. You're okay.

318
00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:02.350
沒事了
You're okay.

319
00:17:02.352 --> 00:17:04.219
他找不到你的
He'll never find you.

320
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.555
不是吧
No.

321
00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:12.394
Ow!

322
00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:14.729

為什麼會這樣
Why is this happening?

326
00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.472

327

他提出了
...is that we...

Okay.

我的房間
My room!

為什麼會這樣
"Why is this happening?"

338
00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:16.195
別在粘著了
"Please stop sticking."

339

千萬別鬆開
"Please keep st..."

340

等等
Wait, wait, wait.

341
00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:22.364
怎麼可能有兩個蜘蛛俠
How could there be two Spider-Men?

342
00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:24.269
不可能有兩個蜘蛛俠
There can't be two Spider-Men.

343
00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:26.835
可能嗎
Can there?

344
00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:32.307
拜託  艾倫叔叔 快接電話
Come on, Uncle Aaron, pick up. Pick up!

我要出城幾天
I'm outta town for a few days.

347
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.812
回來再打給你 再見

No. No-No-No-No-No.

349
00:18:38.249 --> 00:18:40.516
這不可能
It's not possible!

350
00:18:40.518 --> 00:18:42.384
我只是在發育
It's just puberty.

351
00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:45.254
那是只普通的蜘蛛 我是個普通的男孩
It's a normal spider and I'm a normal kid!

352
00:18:47.892 --> 00:18:49.695
精彩
All right!

353
00:18:53.798 --> 00:18:55.901
我得找人聊聊
I gotta tell someone.

354
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.594
是你想多了 邁爾斯 你想多了
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles. You're being crazy.

355
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.896
找到那只蜘蛛
Find the spider.

356
00:19:27.898 --> 00:19:29.500
一切就清楚了
You'll see.

357
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:45.715
只是個普通蜘蛛
It's a normal spider.

358
00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:50.920
感覺  簡直  普通的不能在普通了
It's, like, boring how normal this spider is.

359
00:19:59.864 --> 00:20:01.663
在那邊
I'm right here.

360
00:20:01.665 --> 00:20:03.935
為什麼偏偏是我
Why is this happening to me?

361
00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:12.644
慢點 我這是怎麼了
Slow down! What am I doing?

362
00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:19.782
在那邊
Way over there.

363
00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:20.949
你就和我一樣
You're like me.

364
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:22.785
邁爾斯 小心
Miles. Look out.

365
00:20:22.787 --> 00:20:24.487
我不想成為英雄
I don't wanna be a hero.

366
00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.557
邁爾斯
Miles.

367
00:20:27.625 --> 00:20:28.559
Whoa!

368
00:20:31.929 --> 00:20:34.729
諾曼 你聽我說
Norman, listen to me.

369
00:20:34.731 --> 00:20:36.465
蜘蛛俠
Spider-Man?

370
00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:39.401
我不能讓你打開通往另一個時空的大門
I cannot let you open a portal to another dimension.

371
00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:41.506
布魯克林承受不了這個
Brooklyn is not zoned for that.

372
00:20:42.773 --> 00:20:44.640
這不由我決定
It's not up to me.

373
00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:46.374
那是綠惡魔嗎
Is that Green Goblin?!

374
00:20:46.376 --> 00:20:47.910
你為什麼不能放棄
Why won't you quit?!

375
00:20:47.912 --> 00:20:50.845
因為我不想布魯克林被黑洞吞噬
I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked into a black hole.

376
00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:52.547
我想 我還是快跑吧
I think I'm gonna go.

377
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:54.485
斯塔頓島可以  反正布魯克林不行
Staten Island, maybe. Not Brooklyn.

378
00:20:59.757 --> 00:21:01.623
不 不
No! No!

379
00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:24.950
Whoa!

380
00:21:26.483 --> 00:21:28.351
怎麼辦
What now?

381
00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:29.788
這是什麼地方
What is this place?

382
00:21:56.513 --> 00:21:58.616
知不知道你鞋帶鬆了
Did you know your shoes are untied?

383
00:21:59.717 --> 00:22:01.750
我穿的是連體服
- Uh-huh. - This is a onesie,

384
00:22:01.752 --> 00:22:03.688
所以不用擔心
so I don't really have to worry about it.

385
00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:12.728
我以為我是唯一的 你和我一樣
I thought I was the only one. You're like me.

386
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.162
我可不想
I don't wanna be.

387
00:22:14.164 --> 00:22:17.065
恐怕你沒有的選 孩子
I don't think you have a choice, kiddo.

388
00:22:17.067 --> 00:22:19.634
我能理解你的困惑 相信我
Got a lot going through your head, I'm sure.

389
00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:20.936
當然
Yeah.

390
00:22:20.938 --> 00:22:23.471
你不會有事的 我可以幫你
You're gonna be fine. I can help you.

391
00:22:23.473 --> 00:22:25.841
你等我一下  一會兒我會教你兩招
If you stick around, I can show you the ropes.

392
00:22:25.843 --> 00:22:28.177
好的
Yeah.

393
00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:31.514
我必須得趕在時空連續體崩塌
I just need to destroy this big machine real quick

394
00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.582
之前毀掉那台機器
before the space-time continuum collapses.

395
00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:34.553
別走開
Don't move.

396
00:22:37.587 --> 00:22:39.154
一會見
See you in a bit.

397
00:22:49.834 --> 00:22:51.536
他是怎麼做到的
How does he do that?

398
00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:57.072
是在這嗎 不 是這
Is it here? No, no, it's here.

399
00:22:57.074 --> 00:22:59.507
好了 各位
All right, folks.

400
00:22:59.509 --> 00:23:00.644
派對結束
I always get this wrong.

401
00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:03.048
糟糕
Oh, boy.

402
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.015
徘徊者
Prowler.

403
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.920
夥計 我正忙著呢
Man, I was in the middle of something.

404
00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:15.093
心好累
I am so tired.

405
00:23:18.729 --> 00:23:20.966
你在生我氣嗎 我覺得你是在生我氣
Are you mad at me? I feel like you're mad at me.

406
00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:29.641
就這點能耐
That all you got?

407
00:23:31.875 --> 00:23:33.741
真噁心
Aw, so gross.

408
00:23:33.743 --> 00:23:36.879
我應該上去幫他
I should go up there and help him.

409
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:39.648
開什麼玩笑 這怎麼可能
Who am I kidding? I should not do that.

410
00:23:45.155 --> 00:23:49.123
注意 蜘蛛俠來了
Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man.

411
00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:51.125
喜歡我的新玩具嗎
You like my new toy?

412
00:23:51.127 --> 00:23:55.564
花了我不少錢呢  不過 錢乃身外之物
Cost me a fortune, but, hey, can't take it with you, right?

413
00:23:55.566 --> 00:23:58.834
你大老遠過來 觀看我的試驗
You came all this way. Watch the test.

414
00:23:58.836 --> 00:24:00.268
這會是場超炫的燈光秀
It's a hell of a freaking light show.

415
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.205
你一定會喜歡的
You're gonna love this.

416
00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:08.110
不 別這樣 快停下
No! No, don't do this! Stop!

417
00:24:08.112 --> 00:24:11.580
你不知道它能做什麼  你會害死我們的
You don't know what it can do! You'll kill us all!

418
00:24:26.163 --> 00:24:29.097
我看到了多個宇宙正在開啟
I see multiple dimensions opening!

419
00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:34.068
三個 四個 五個 不同的宇宙
That was three, four and five separate dimensions.

420
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.073
它們很不穩定 得馬上停下來
It's unstable! We should stop.

421
00:24:48.786 --> 00:24:51.056
諾曼 你一般怎麼處理頭部創傷
Norm, what's your take on head trauma?

422
00:24:54.858 --> 00:24:56.894
我都提醒你了
I tried to warn you, pal.

423
00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:12.744
綠惡魔 不 把他弄出去
Goblin, no! Get him outta there!

424
00:25:19.016 --> 00:25:20.852
威爾遜 我們在哪裏
Wilson! Where are we?

425
00:25:22.752 --> 00:25:24.620
好奇怪
Really weird.

426
00:25:24.622 --> 00:25:25.990
威爾遜
Wilson!

427
00:25:59.356 --> 00:26:01.990
嘿  你沒事吧
Hey! Are you okay?

428
00:26:01.992 --> 00:26:04.028
我沒事 我沒事 只是需要休息一下
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just resting.

429
00:26:05.762 --> 00:26:07.696
-還能站起來嗎 -當然
- Can't you get up? - Yeah.

430
00:26:07.698 --> 00:26:09.898
我每次都能站起來
Yeah, I always get up.

431
00:26:11.368 --> 00:26:13.736
咳嗽可能不是個好兆頭
The coughing's probably not a good sign.

432
00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:15.770
找到他 快
Find him. Now.

433
00:26:15.772 --> 00:26:19.074
聽著 我們得合作 時間不多了
Listen, we gotta team up here. We don't have that much time.

434
00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:21.943
只有這把重載鑰匙能阻止對撞機
This override key is the only way to stop the collider.

435
00:26:21.945 --> 00:26:25.648
蕩過去 用這把鑰匙 摁下紅色按鈕 炸飛它
Swing up there, use this key, push the button and blow it up.

436
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.981
你得把臉藏起來
You need to hide your face.

437
00:26:26.983 --> 00:26:29.218
別告訴任何人你是誰
You don't tell anyone who you are.

438
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.286
誰都不能說 他能撬開任何人得嘴
No one can know. He's got everyone in his pocket.

439
00:26:32.288 --> 00:26:34.155
如果他再次啟動機器
If he turns the machine on again,

440
00:26:34.157 --> 00:26:36.091
你所知道的一切都會消失
everything you know will disappear.

441
00:26:36.093 --> 00:26:38.026
你的家人  所有人
Your family, everyone.

442
00:26:38.028 --> 00:26:40.429
所有人
Everyone.

443
00:26:40.431 --> 00:26:42.834
答應我好嗎
Promise me you'll do this.

444
00:26:47.203 --> 00:26:48.703
我答應你
I promise.

445
00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:51.673
去吧  毀了對撞機
Go. Destroy the collider.

446
00:26:51.675 --> 00:26:53.142
我會去找你的
I'll come and find you.

447
00:26:54.878 --> 00:26:56.046
不會有事的
It's gonna be okay.

448
00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:05.853
墓碑
Tombstone.

449
00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:07.057
試驗到此結束
We're done with tests.

450
00:27:08.826 --> 00:27:12.026
盡快準備好再啟動一次
Get that thing ready to go again. And soon.

451
00:27:12.028 --> 00:27:13.996
快跑
Run faster!

452
00:27:13.998 --> 00:27:15.730
這群傢伙真沒用
These guys are weak.

453
00:27:15.732 --> 00:27:18.467
本想說很高興又見到你了 蜘蛛俠
I'd say it's nice to see you again, Spider-Man,

454
00:27:18.469 --> 00:27:19.834
可惜不是
but it's not.

455
00:27:19.836 --> 00:27:21.335
嘿 金並 生意好嗎
Hey, Kingpin. How's business?

456
00:27:21.337 --> 00:27:22.938
很火爆
Boomin'. Heh.

457
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.275
好吧 這樣可不行
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

458
00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.876
你這麼做會在布魯克林的下面撕開一個黑洞
This might open a black hole under Brooklyn.

459
00:27:28.878 --> 00:27:31.313
不能冒這個險
It can't be worth the risk.

460
00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:34.152
不是所有事都是為了錢 蜘蛛俠
It's not always about the money, Spider-Man.

461
00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.989
你不想知道我看到了什麼嗎
Don't you wanna know what I saw in there?

462
00:27:41.991 --> 00:27:43.060
等等
Wait.

463
00:27:44.394 --> 00:27:47.296
我知道你想幹什麼
I know what you're trying to do,

464
00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:49.097
這麼做沒用的
and it won't work.

465
00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:50.201
他們已經死了
They're gone.

466
00:28:04.248 --> 00:28:05.780
把屍體處理掉
Get rid of the body.

467
00:28:05.782 --> 00:28:08.382
誰在哪裏
What was that?

468
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.323
殺了他
Kill that guy.

469
00:28:47.023 --> 00:28:49.458
別粘著了
Stop sticking!

470
00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:10.981
請勿依靠車門 謝謝
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

471
00:29:36.073 --> 00:29:37.876
應該是班克斯風格的街頭藝術
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

472
00:29:47.183 --> 00:29:49.151
警察 把手舉起來
Police! Put your hands up!

473
00:29:49.153 --> 00:29:50.889
邁爾斯 邁爾斯
Miles? Miles?

474
00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:53.622
你怎麼不在學校
Why aren't you at school?

475
00:29:53.624 --> 00:29:56.959
怎麼了 沒事了 沒事了
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

476
00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.228
邁爾斯 出什麼事了
Miles? ¿Que te pasa?

477
00:30:01.932 --> 00:30:03.300
是因為地震嗎
Is it the earthquake?

478
00:30:05.035 --> 00:30:06.602
我今晚能留下嗎
Can I sleep here tonight?

479
00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:08.269
邁爾斯 今天不是週末
Miles. It's a weeknight.

480
00:30:08.271 --> 00:30:10.205
你應該待在學校的
You made a commitment to that school.

481
00:30:10.207 --> 00:30:11.810
他不舒服
He's upset.

482
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:16.213
你當然能留下
Of course you can stay.

483
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.982
-爸爸 -怎麼
- Dad? - Yeah.

484
00:30:20.284 --> 00:30:23.184
你真的很討厭蜘蛛俠嗎
Do you really hate Spider-Man?

485
00:30:25.189 --> 00:30:27.989
是吧  我是說 身為一名警察
Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is...

486
00:30:27.991 --> 00:30:29.290
傑弗森 親愛的
Jeff, mi amor.

487
00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:31.259
怎麼了 是他問我的
What? He asked me.

488
00:30:31.261 --> 00:30:33.897
你知道我對蜘蛛俠的看法
Baby, you know how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on.

489
00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:38.033
你知道他很愛你
Tu sabes que el te quiere mucho.

490
00:30:38.035 --> 00:30:40.969
所以才會這麼嚴格 你懂的對吧
That's why he's tough on you. You know that, right?

491
00:30:40.971 --> 00:30:45.340
媽媽 你有沒有想過離開布魯克林
Mom, do you ever think about moving out of Brooklyn?

492
00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:49.044
我們家的人從不逃避問題 邁爾斯
Our family doesn't run from things, Miles.

493
00:30:49.046 --> 00:30:51.182
對 我知道
Yeah, I know.

494
00:30:54.151 --> 00:30:55.517
到底怎麼回事
What's that about?

495
00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:57.286
她正處於艱難期 傑夫
He's having a hard time, Jeff.

496
00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:58.620
越是艱難
When it gets hard,

497
00:30:58.622 --> 00:31:00.421
他越是應該堅持 你應該更溫柔一點
that's when he's gotta stick it out.

498
00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:10.132
插播一條特別消息
We interrupt this broadcast for a special report.

499
00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:11.466
一則悲痛的消息
Sad news tonight.

500
00:31:11.468 --> 00:31:15.370
我們的英雄蜘蛛俠 今天離開了我們
The hero known as Spider-Man has died

501
00:31:15.372 --> 00:31:18.105
他的死與今天發生在布魯克林的
after injuries related to another powerful earthquake

502
00:31:18.107 --> 00:31:20.942
另一場神秘地震事件有關
in Brooklyn. Multiple sources are confirming

503
00:31:20.944 --> 00:31:23.312
經多方消息證實 彼得 帕克

My husband, Peter Parker,

514
00:31:51.307 --> 00:31:54.109
他曾是一個普通人
was an ordinary person.

515
00:31:54.111 --> 00:31:57.511
他總是說誰都能成為面具後面的那個人
He always said it could've been anyone behind the mask.

516
00:31:57.513 --> 00:32:01.415
他只是湊巧被蜘蛛咬了而已
He was just the kid who happened to get bit.

517
00:32:01.417 --> 00:32:03.751
我會想念他的
I'm going to miss him.

是啊
Yeah.

我們以前可是朋友
We were friends, you know.

520
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.190
如果不合身 我能來退嗎
Can I return it if it doesn't fit?

521
00:32:09.192 --> 00:32:11.526
到最後
It always fits

522
00:32:11.528 --> 00:32:13.431
總會合身的
eventually.

523
00:32:19.502 --> 00:32:21.505
這並不是他的本意
He didn't ask for his powers,

524
00:32:24.607 --> 00:32:28.176
可他選擇成為了蜘蛛俠
but he chose to be Spider-Man.

525
00:32:28.178 --> 00:32:30.778
我最愛彼得的地方就是
My favorite thing about Peter

526
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.583
他讓我們所有人都充滿了力量
is that he made us each feel powerful.

527
00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:38.586

他們需要我
They're counting on me.

533
00:32:50.666 --> 00:32:54.371
應該不是特指你 只是個比喻而已
Probably not you specifically. I think it's a metaphor.

534
00:34:45.481 --> 00:34:48.182
我很抱歉 帕克先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

我可能把它弄壞了
I think I really messed it up.

我也想遵守約定
I really do.

539
00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:03.430
對不起
But I'm sorry.

540
00:35:03.432 --> 00:35:06.700
沒有你
I'm not sure I'm the guy.

541
00:35:06.702 --> 00:35:09.637
我一個人根本不行
I can't do this without you.

542
00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:11.206
嘿 孩子
Hey, kid.

543
00:35:13.677 --> 00:35:14.778
Whoa!

544

我對他做了什麼
What did I do to him?!

545
00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:31.596
不
No.

你是誰
Who are you?

547
00:35:39.835 --> 00:35:42.873
好吧 各位 我們最後再來一次
All right, people, let's do this one last time.

548
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:47.409
我叫彼得 班傑明 帕克
My name is Peter B. Parker.

549
00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:50.612
我被一隻受過輻射的蜘蛛咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

550
00:35:50.614 --> 00:35:52.847
在接下來的二十二年裏
And for the last 22 years,

551
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:56.586
我以為我是這世上唯一的蜘蛛俠
I thought I was the one and only Spider-Man.

552
00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:59.420
忙碌的一天
What a day.

553
00:35:59.422 --> 00:36:01.755
剩下的你們肯定都知道了
I'm pretty sure you know the rest.

554
00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:04.659
我救過這座城市  墜入過愛河 還結了婚
You see, I saved the city, fell in love, I got married,

555
00:36:04.661 --> 00:36:06.827
又救了幾次城市 或許太多次了
saved the city some more, maybe too much.

556
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:09.731
我的婚姻出現了危機  投資了一些糟糕的項目
My marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices.

557
00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:11.900
千萬別投以蜘蛛俠為名的主題餐廳
Don't invest in a spider-themed restaurant.

558
00:36:11.902 --> 00:36:14.836
就這樣過去了15年 吧啦 吧啦 吧啦
Then like 15 years passed. Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.

559
00:36:14.838 --> 00:36:17.472
超級無聊 我摔斷了背脊  臉撞在了無人機上
I broke my back, a drone flew into my face,

560
00:36:17.474 --> 00:36:18.539
送走了梅嬸嬸
I buried Aunt May.

561
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:20.641
最後和我的妻子分開了
My wife and I split up.

562
00:36:20.643 --> 00:36:22.876
但這一切我都沉著以對
But I handled it like a champion.

563
00:36:22.878 --> 00:36:24.746
你知道嗎
'Cause, you know what,

564
00:36:24.748 --> 00:36:26.581
因為不管遭受多少次打擊
no matter how many times I get hit,

565
00:36:26.583 --> 00:36:29.483
我最終總是會爬起來的
I always get back up.

566
00:36:33.023 --> 00:36:36.657
我有大把的時間自我反省
And I got a lot of time to reflect and work on myself.

567
00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:39.793
你知道嗎 海馬一旦結合 就再也不會分開了
Did you know that seahorses, that they mate for life?

568
00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:41.762
你能想像嗎
Could you imagine?

569
00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:44.932
一隻海馬 見到了另一隻海馬
A seahorse seeing another seahorse

570
00:36:44.934 --> 00:36:46.834
然後他們就成了
and then making it work?

571
00:36:47.938 --> 00:36:50.771
她想要孩子 可是
She wanted kids and...

572
00:36:50.773 --> 00:36:52.609
這嚇壞我了
And it scared me.

573
00:36:53.976 --> 00:36:56.577
我知道我傷心了她的心
I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.

574
00:36:56.579 --> 00:36:58.947
閃進 當時我正在家裏做俯臥撐
Flash-forward: I'm in my apartment doing push-ups,

575
00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:00.981
還有仰臥起坐 讓自己變得更強
doing ab crunches, getting strong,

576
00:37:00.983 --> 00:37:03.351
突然奇怪的事發生了
when this weird thing happened.

577
00:37:03.353 --> 00:37:06.688
雖然我對奇怪的事已經見慣不怪了
And I gotta say, weird things happen to me a lot.

578
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.659
可是 這次的情況真的很奇怪
But this was real weird.

579
00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:52.836
Ow!

580
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:58.106
我還在紐約 可周圍不太一樣
You see, I was in New York, but things were different.

581
00:37:58.108 --> 00:38:00.809
而且我死了
Also, I was dead.

582
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:02.476
還有一頭金髮
And blond.

583
00:38:02.478 --> 00:38:04.713
我看起來簡直完美
I was kind of perfect.

584
00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:08.516
感覺就像是在照鏡子一樣
It was like looking in a mirror.

585
00:38:08.518 --> 00:38:10.552
我有種直覺
I have a feeling that the thing

586
00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.985
帶我來到這裏的東西
that brought me here

587
00:38:11.987 --> 00:38:14.889
就是害死他的原因
was the thing that got him killed.

588
00:38:14.891 --> 00:38:16.925
想知道接下來發生了什麼
You wanna know what happened next?

589
00:38:20.996 --> 00:38:22.463
我也想知道
Me, too.

590
00:38:22.465 --> 00:38:23.932
你是誰
Who are you?

591
00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.900
你在哪裏幹嘛
What are you doin' over there?

592
00:38:25.902 --> 00:38:28.369
別動 紐約警察
Freeze! P.D.N.Y.

593
00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:29.440
站住
Stop!

594
00:38:33.409 --> 00:38:35.476
這是在逗我呢嗎
Are you kidding me right now?

595
00:38:35.478 --> 00:38:36.945
站住 站住
Stop! Stop!

596
00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.646
我帶你走 我帶你走
I gotcha. I gotcha.

597
00:38:38.648 --> 00:38:40.451
嘿 小子 放小屍體
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

598
00:38:42.786 --> 00:38:45.586
-嘿 小子 快過來 -別跑
- Hey, kid. Get over here! - Come on, now!

599
00:38:45.588 --> 00:38:46.523
Whoa.

600
00:38:47.623 --> 00:38:50.691
回頭見 警官
See you, officers!

601
00:38:50.693 --> 00:38:51.961
不是吧
Aw, come on.

602
00:38:57.634 --> 00:39:00.068
-嘿 小子 -別亂動
- Hey, kid. - Kid, come on, now!

603
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.772
舉起手 孩子
Put 'em up, son!

604
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:07.175
再見
Uh... adios?

605
00:39:11.114 --> 00:39:13.981
救命 快讓火車停下
Help! Somebody stop that train!

606
00:39:31.534 --> 00:39:33.168
嘿 什麼情況
Oh, hey. What the...?

607
00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:37.541
抱歉
Sorry.

608
00:39:40.643 --> 00:39:44.481
要死翹翹啦
I'm gonna die!

609
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:50.952
情況好像是 一個打扮成蜘蛛俠的孩子
Looks like a child dressed like Spider-Man

610
00:39:50.954 --> 00:39:53.054
拖著一個流浪漢的屍體在追火車
dragging a homeless corpse behind a train.

611
00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:56.590
太好了 我沒殺了你
Yes! I didn't kill you.

612
00:39:56.592 --> 00:39:58.592
-你是誰 -你又是誰
- Who are you? - Who are you?

613
00:39:58.594 --> 00:39:59.760
你為什麼想要殺我
Why are you trying to kill me?

614
00:39:59.762 --> 00:40:01.531
我沒有 我是想要救你
I'm not. I'm trying to save you.

615
00:40:20.784 --> 00:40:23.083
麻煩繞道走好嗎
Hey, maybe you guys can go around?

616
00:40:23.085 --> 00:40:26.723
好吧 謝謝配合
All right. Thanks, New York.

617
00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.599
什麼情況
What was that?

618
00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:41.135
那孩子電擊了我
Kid electrocuted me

619
00:40:41.137 --> 00:40:43.003
用他的手嗎
with his hands.

620
00:40:46.141 --> 00:40:48.809
-你和我一樣 -我有話要問你
- You're like me. - I got some questions.

621
00:40:53.516 --> 00:40:55.148
你為什麼那麼像彼得 帕克
Why do you look like Peter Parker?

622
00:40:57.586 --> 00:40:59.153
因為我就是彼得 帕克
Because I am Peter Parker.

623
00:40:59.155 --> 00:41:02.023
那你怎麼沒死 頭髮也不一樣了
Then why aren't you dead? And why is your hair different?

624
00:41:02.025 --> 00:41:04.559
為什麼你變老了 還有你的體型
Why are you older? And why is your body

625
00:41:04.561 --> 00:41:06.026
怎麼變形了
a different shape?

626
00:41:06.028 --> 00:41:07.829
你是想說我胖是吧
Pretty sure you just called me fat.

627
00:41:07.831 --> 00:41:09.796
你也沒帥到哪裏去 小子
You don't look so hot either, kid.

628
00:41:09.798 --> 00:41:11.932
超級英雄不會買自己的周邊
Most superheroes don't wear their own merch.

629
00:41:11.934 --> 00:41:13.066
-你是鬼魂嗎 -不是
- Are you a ghost? - No.

630
00:41:13.068 --> 00:41:14.536
-你是殭屍嗎  -你話太多了
- Are you a zombie? - Stop it.

631
00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.204
-我是殭屍嗎 =別扯淡了
- Am I a zombie? - You're not even close.

632
00:41:16.206 --> 00:41:18.940
你來自另一個時空 就像平行宇宙
Are you from another dimension? Like a parallel universe

633
00:41:18.942 --> 00:41:20.275
彼此相似但卻又不相同
where things are like this universe but different?

634
00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:22.142
你是哪裏的蜘蛛俠
And you're Spider-Man in that universe?

635
00:41:22.144 --> 00:41:24.045
然後你穿越到了這裏
But somehow traveled to this universe,

636
00:41:24.047 --> 00:41:25.213
而你並不知道原因
but you don't know how?

637
00:41:25.215 --> 00:41:26.847
你真的只是隨便猜猜的
Wow. That was really just a guess?

638
00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:28.715
其實 我們在物理課上學過
We learned about it in physics.

639
00:41:28.717 --> 00:41:30.751
-量子理論 -這太酷了
- Quantum theory. - This is amazing!

640
00:41:30.753 --> 00:41:32.820
那你就可以像彼得 帕克說的那樣教我了
You can teach me like Peter said he would.

641
00:41:32.822 --> 00:41:33.921
在他生前
Before he died.

642
00:41:33.923 --> 00:41:35.188
-對 沒錯 -好吧
- Yeah. Exactly. - Yeah, right.

643
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.958
聽著 我答應過他的
Look, I made a promise to him.

644
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.659
我現在就來教你第一課 小子
Here's lesson number one, kid.

645
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:41.762
別光顧著聽 要仔細看
Don't watch the mouth. Watch the hands.

646
00:41:46.302 --> 00:41:48.239
彼特 我是認真的
Peter, seriously...

647
00:41:50.106 --> 00:41:52.273
相信我 孩子
Trust me, kid.

648
00:41:52.275 --> 00:41:54.608
這樣你會過的輕鬆一點
This'll all make you a better Spider-Man.

649
00:41:59.748 --> 00:42:01.316
嘿 你還好嗎
Hey, are you okay?

650
00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.717
不 很不好
No, I'm not.

651
00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:04.117
你的身體怎麼了
What's going on with your body?

652
00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:06.019
我的原子可能
I don't think my atoms are real jazzed

653
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:07.789
不太適應這個錯誤的時空
about being in the wrong dimension.

654
00:42:10.025 --> 00:42:11.959
聽著 我不是來應聘兼職
Look, I'm not looking for a side gig

655
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:13.360
做蜘蛛俠教練的
as a Spider-Man coach.

656
00:42:13.362 --> 00:42:15.662
在我的世界我還有很多事前要處理
I got a lot going on in my dimension.

657
00:42:15.664 --> 00:42:17.764
能力越大 責任就
"With great power comes great..."

658
00:42:17.766 --> 00:42:19.367
別在我面前說那句話
Don't you dare finish that sentence.

659
00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:21.135
別再說了 我受夠了
Don't do it! I'm sick of it.

660
00:42:25.007 --> 00:42:27.909
想要我的意見 做回普通小孩吧
Want my advice? Go back to being a regular kid.

661
00:42:27.911 --> 00:42:29.077
我根本沒得選
I don't have a choice!

662
00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.644
金並造了一架對撞機
Kingpin's got a supercollider.

663
00:42:30.646 --> 00:42:32.079
他想要殺了我
He's tryin' to kill me.

664
00:42:32.081 --> 00:42:34.148
-你剛才說什麼 -金並想要殺了我
- What did you just say? - Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

665
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.249
誰關心這個 對撞機在哪裏
Who cares about that. Where's the collider?

666
00:42:36.251 --> 00:42:38.119
布魯克林 菲斯克大樓下面
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

667
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:39.287
-再見  -你要去哪裏
- Goodbye. - Where you going?

668
00:42:39.289 --> 00:42:40.954
等它再啟動時 只要跳進去
When it runs again, I'll jump in

669
00:42:40.956 --> 00:42:42.389
-就能回家了 -不能重啟對撞機
- and get back to my life. - You can't let them run it.

670
00:42:42.391 --> 00:42:43.958
我的任務就是毀了它
I'm supposed to destroy it

671
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.026
阻止它再次啟動 否則所有人都會死
so it never runs again or everyone's gonna die.

672
00:42:46.028 --> 00:42:49.697
否則所有人都會死  他們每次都愛說這句話
"Or everyone's gonna die." That is what they always say.

673
00:42:49.699 --> 00:42:52.700
但在「所有人都會死」之前總還會有點時間
But there's always a little bit of time before everybody dies

674
00:42:52.702 --> 00:42:54.068
這時就要看我的了
and that's when I do my best work.

675
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.769
你難道不需要這個嗎
Aren't you gonna need this?

676
00:42:55.771 --> 00:42:57.371
你有個小玩意啊  交給我
Aw, you have a goober. Give it.

677
00:42:57.373 --> 00:43:00.842
等等 不 沒那麼容易 他管它叫重載鑰匙
Wait, no. Not so fast. He called it an override key.

678
00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:03.677
總會有把漏洞鑰匙 病毒鑰匙  各種亂七八糟的鑰匙
There's always a bypass key, a virus key, a who-cares key.

679
00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:04.912
記都記不清
I can never remember,

680
00:43:04.914 --> 00:43:06.146
所以索性叫它們小玩意  交給我
so I always call it a goober. Give it.

681
00:43:06.148 --> 00:43:07.882
我需要它幫我摧毀對撞機
I need it to destroy the collider.

682
00:43:07.884 --> 00:43:09.282
我需要它幫我回家
I need it to go home.

683
00:43:09.284 --> 00:43:10.885
不行 再逼我 我就吞了它
I'll swallow it. Don't play with me.

684
00:43:10.887 --> 00:43:13.021
-什麼 -我說
- What? - I said...

685
00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:15.423
對撞機打開了入口 把我帶到了這裏
The collider created a portal that brought me here.

686
00:43:15.425 --> 00:43:17.057
所以我得
And I have to get...

687
00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:21.195
-你把它搞壞了 -不 本來就是壞的
- Did you break this? - No, it broke.

688
00:43:21.197 --> 00:43:22.829
我不記得發生了什麼
I don't remember what happened.

689
00:43:22.831 --> 00:43:24.365
看到沒 所以我才不要孩子 簡直太明智了
See, this is why I never had kids.

690
00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:25.932
我們不能再做一個嗎
Can't we make another one?

691
00:43:25.934 --> 00:43:27.969
這裏沒有你什麼事  多虧了你
We can't do anything. Thanks to you,

692
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:30.938
我得重複那個傢伙的工作  去歐克馬克斯再偷一次數據
I have to re-steal what your guy stole from Alchemax

693
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.807
做一個新鑰匙
and make another one of these.

694
00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:35.842
如果你走之後我沒能關掉對撞機
If I don't turn off the collider after you leave,

695
00:43:35.844 --> 00:43:37.345
這座城市的每個人
everyone in this city,

696
00:43:37.347 --> 00:43:40.213
我的父母 我的叔叔  成千上萬的人都會死
my parents, my uncle and millions of others, will die.

697
00:43:40.215 --> 00:43:41.883
你打算就這麼一走了之
And you're just gonna go home

698
00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:44.184
把我一個人留在這裏面對這一切
and leave me here to figure this out for myself?

699
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:47.156
-你做得出這種事嗎 蜘蛛俠 -我能
- You good with that, Spider-Man? - Yeah.

700
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.398
你蹲在哪裏幹嘛
What are you doing?

701
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.769
讓你良心不安  有效果嗎
Making you feel guilty. Is it working?

702
00:44:02.771 --> 00:44:05.039
怎麼可能 不 你看我
How could it...? No. Look at me.

703
00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:06.807
像有效果的樣子嗎
Does it look like it's working?

704
00:44:06.809 --> 00:44:10.346
不 沒有 當然沒有
No. No, it's not...

705
00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:16.987
不行 不能讓他得逞
No! No! No! Do not let him win!

706
00:44:18.054 --> 00:44:19.420
好吧 孩子 你贏了
All right, kid. You win.

707
00:44:19.422 --> 00:44:21.923
走吧 我們沒時間浪費了
Come on, we don't have a second to lose.

708
00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:24.758
我超喜歡這漢堡 太好吃了
Mmm. I love this burger. So delicious.

709
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.728
我吃過的最好的漢堡之一
One of the best burgers I've ever had.

710
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.396
在我們哪裏 這地方六年前就關門了
In my universe, this place closed six years ago.

711
00:44:29.398 --> 00:44:31.264
真搞不懂 明明很好吃
I don't know why. I really don't.

712
00:44:31.266 --> 00:44:32.268
Mmm.

713
00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:37.003
你帶錢了對吧 我最近手頭有點緊
You have money, right? I'm not very liquid right now.

714
00:44:37.005 --> 00:44:38.805
-說正經事好嗎  -當然
- Can we focus? - Mm-hm. Sure.

715
00:44:38.807 --> 00:44:41.344
-另一個彼得 -你不吃嗎
- The other Peter... - You gonna eat that?

716
00:44:42.378 --> 00:44:43.778
我在聽呢
I'm listening.

717
00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.378
另一個彼得之前
The other Peter said he was gonna be

718
00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.280
說過他會教我幾招
- showing me the ropes. - Wow.

719
00:44:47.282 --> 00:44:50.016
你有什麼蜘蛛俠竅門可以教我嗎
You got any Spider-Man tips you can tell me now?

720
00:44:50.018 --> 00:44:51.017
多了去了
Yeah, I got plenty.

721
00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:52.452
面具要消毒
Disinfect the mask.

722
00:44:52.454 --> 00:44:54.921
穿緊身衣要撲點爽身粉
You're gonna wanna use baby powder in the suit,

723
00:44:54.923 --> 00:44:56.124
尤其事關節部分
heavy on the joints.

724
00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.291
你也不想出疹子 對吧
You don't want any chafing, right?

725
00:44:58.293 --> 00:45:00.795
-還有別的嗎 -沒了 就這些
- Anything else? - Nope, that was everything.

726
00:45:00.797 --> 00:45:02.496
你這老師也太差勁了吧
I think you're gonna be a bad teacher.

727
00:45:02.498 --> 00:45:05.032
查查歐克馬克思在哪裏
Uh-uh-uh? Look up where Alchemax is.

728
00:45:05.034 --> 00:45:08.401
紐約哈德遜山谷的一家私人科技園區
"A private technological campus in Hudson Valley, New York."

729
00:45:08.403 --> 00:45:09.903
你可以教我
You can teach me

730
00:45:09.905 --> 00:45:11.171
怎麼蕩過去
to swing on the way there.

731
00:45:14.476 --> 00:45:16.844
我們不可能一路蕩到哈德遜山谷
I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley, Miles.

732
00:45:16.846 --> 00:45:18.780
尤其是吃了漢堡大餐之後
Not after a hearty burger breakfast.

733
00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:21.085
節省點體力 你會感謝我的
Keep your legs fresh. You're gonna thank me later.

734
00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:25.253
♪ I can see a new horizon ♪

735
00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:27.088
♪ Underneath the blazing sky ♪

736
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.258
♪ I'll be where the eagle's Flying higher... ♪

737
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.425
-還有別穿斗篷 -我覺得還挺酷的
- And it's a no on the cape. - I think it's cool.

738
00:45:32.427 --> 00:45:34.162
快脫掉 丟死人了
Take that off. It's disrespectful.

739
00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:36.130
蜘蛛俠不穿斗篷
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

740
00:45:36.132 --> 00:45:39.233
我們要怎麼重複彼得的工作
So how do we retrace Peter's steps?

741
00:45:39.235 --> 00:45:41.202
這是個好問題
That's a good question.

742
00:45:41.204 --> 00:45:44.041
如果我是我 我會怎麼做
What would I do if I were me?

743
00:45:44.873 --> 00:45:46.206
有了
Got it.

744
00:45:46.208 --> 00:45:48.208
第一步 先潛入實驗室
I infiltrate the lab.

745
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.177
第二步 找到首席科學家的電腦
Find the head scientist's computer.

746
00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:52.380
那位推自行車的女士就是
That lady with the bike is the head scientist.

747
00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.447
我在學校的紀錄片裏見過她
I saw her in this documentary.

748
00:45:54.449 --> 00:45:56.883
很好 第三步 暫時拋開性別歧視
Cool! Step Three: I reexamine my personal biases.

749
00:45:56.885 --> 00:45:58.119
第四步 黑近她的電腦
I hack the computer.

750
00:45:58.121 --> 00:45:59.452
其實也不算黑進去
It's not technically hacking.

751
00:45:59.454 --> 00:46:01.488
應該是 行了 別打斷我的思路
Not now. I just lost my train of thought.

752
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.423
第五步 下載重要信息
Download the important stuff.

753
00:46:03.425 --> 00:46:05.226
看到我就知道
I'll know it when I see it.

754
00:46:05.228 --> 00:46:08.095
第六步 從餐廳抓一個麵包圈 然後拔腿就跑
I grab a bagel from the cafeteria and run.

755
00:46:08.097 --> 00:46:09.863
那我要幹嘛
So, what am I doing?

756
00:46:09.865 --> 00:46:12.999
第七步 你在這裏把風 非常重要
Step Seven: You stay here. You're lookout. Very important.

757
00:46:13.001 --> 00:46:15.603
聽著 夥計 你得教我蜘蛛俠的技能
Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do Spider-Man stuff

758
00:46:15.605 --> 00:46:17.204
這樣我才能幫你
or I won't be able to help.

759
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:21.309
好的 學著點 小子 一會兒我來考你
Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later!

760
00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:25.345
為什麼我要和這個又老又矬的
Why did I get stuck with

761
00:46:25.347 --> 00:46:27.581
流浪蜘蛛俠在一起
the janky, old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!

762
00:46:29.117 --> 00:46:30.985
新技能
That's new.

763
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.298
金並
Kingpin.

764
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.001
我在幹嘛 我在幹嘛
What am I doing? What am I doing?

765
00:46:47.003 --> 00:46:48.438
我在幹嘛 我在幹嘛
What am I doing? What am I doing?

766
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.981
Whoa!

767
00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:07.054
彼得
Peter!

768
00:47:07.056 --> 00:47:08.889
彼得
Peter!

769
00:47:08.891 --> 00:47:10.258
彼得
Peter!

770
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.360
-你在這裏幹嘛 -金並來了
- What are you doing here? - Kingpin's here.

771
00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.894
你往邊上去點
Just move over.

772
00:47:13.896 --> 00:47:16.597
你壓著我腳了 趕緊爬過去
You're steppin' on my foot. Go back outside.

773
00:47:16.599 --> 00:47:19.099
不 我不能眼睜睜看著蜘蛛俠遇難
No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man die

774
00:47:19.101 --> 00:47:20.568
自己卻什麼都不做
without doing anything about it.

775
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.070
我不會再那麼做了
I'm not doing that again.

776
00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:24.671
幹嘛
What?

777
00:47:24.673 --> 00:47:28.642
我遇到的人大多都是想要殺了我的
Most people I meet in the workplace try to kill me,

778
00:47:28.644 --> 00:47:30.313
所以換種畫風也不錯
so you're a nice change of pace.

779
00:47:31.581 --> 00:47:33.613
菲斯克先生  請看數據
Mr. Fisk! Look at this data.

780
00:47:33.615 --> 00:47:35.516
我知道你不理解
I know you can't really understand it,

781
00:47:35.518 --> 00:47:37.186
但這些都是好消息
but these are really good numbers.

782
00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.021
我知道密碼了
And I got the password.

783
00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:42.456
菲斯克先生 如果本周再次重啟對撞機
Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week

784
00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:45.092
布魯克林的下面就會產生一個黑洞
there could be a black hole under Brooklyn.

785
00:47:45.094 --> 00:47:46.626
你看這個 還有這個
You see this? And this?

786
00:47:46.628 --> 00:47:48.262
這就是多重宇宙開始
This is multiple dimensions

787
00:47:48.264 --> 00:47:50.498
相互擠壓得跡象
beginning to crash into each other.

788
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.666
這是蜘蛛俠劇情得老套路
This is pretty standard Spider-Man stakes.

789
00:47:52.668 --> 00:47:54.434
要慢慢習慣 看好了
You get used to it. Watch this.

790
00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:57.271
他會說  我再給你24小時
He's gonna say, "You've got 24 hours."

791
00:47:57.273 --> 00:47:58.572
我再給你24小時
You've got 24 hours.

792
00:47:58.574 --> 00:48:00.675
這麼做的話可能會導致
What this means is there could be a rupture

793
00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:02.175
連續時空裏出現裂縫
in the space-time continuum.

794
00:48:02.177 --> 00:48:03.411
太糟了
Ooh. That's bad.

795
00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:05.012
其實她說的句句都很糟糕
Actually, everything she said was bad.

796
00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:06.012
是我輕敵了
I was lying before.

797
00:48:14.556 --> 00:48:17.360
好吧 等等 還有別的數據
Hold on. Let me get you some more data.

798
00:48:19.228 --> 00:48:22.028
-你在幹嗎 夥計 -我動不了了
- What are you doing, bud? - I can't move.

799
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.530
好了 放鬆你的手指
Okay, relax your fingers.

800
00:48:23.532 --> 00:48:26.566
我們沒時間了 放手 放掉就好  進入狀態
We don't have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.

801
00:48:26.568 --> 00:48:28.668
我在狀態裏 而且是糟糕的狀態
I am in the moment. It's a terrible moment.

802
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.338
-我不是在拒絕 -別再找借口了
- I'm not refusing. - No more excuses.

803
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.007
我只是需要時間
I just need more time.

804
00:48:33.009 --> 00:48:35.108
他們就在外面 你會被發現的
They're right there. They're gonna see you.

805
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.043
邁爾斯 你得趕緊鬆手
Miles, you gotta unstick.

806
00:48:37.045 --> 00:48:38.979
你一般怎麼做才會放鬆
What do you do to relax?

807
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:42.083
放鬆 好的 好的
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

808
00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:45.219
無需多說 我已明瞭
♪ Needless to say, I... ♪

809
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:47.253
還有這種操作
Oh, for crying out loud.

810
00:48:47.255 --> 00:48:50.023
如果現在放棄 寶貝 我承受不起
♪ Callin' it quits Now, baby, I'm a wreck ♪

811
00:48:51.527 --> 00:48:54.394
♪ You're a wreck, ooh... ♪

812
00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:59.102
小屁孩果然不靠譜
just the worst.

813
00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:03.737
-邁爾斯 你去哪裏了 -我就在這裏
- Miles, where did you go? - I'm right here.

814
00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:07.173
-在哪裏 我看不見你 -我就在你面前
- Where? I can't see ya. - I'm right in front of you.

815
00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:09.709
-蜘蛛俠能隱身嗎 -在我們哪裏不行
- Can Spider-Man turn invisible? - Not in my universe.

816
00:49:09.711 --> 00:49:11.612
你戳到我眼睛了
Aah! You just poked me in my eye!

817
00:49:11.614 --> 00:49:14.382
真是不可思議 像是打不過就閃的本能
This is incredible. Some kind of fight or flight thing.

818
00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:15.318
什麼意思
What's that?

819
00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:20.653
把密碼記下來
Remember this password. D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D...

820
00:49:20.655 --> 00:49:21.655
慢點
Slow down!

821
00:49:21.657 --> 00:49:25.092
-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

822
00:49:25.094 --> 00:49:27.394
-我得寫下了 -接著下載設計圖
- I need to write it down! - Download the schematic.

823
00:49:27.396 --> 00:49:29.967
-我要怎麼做 -然後看我使出美男計
- How do I do that? - While I turn on the charm.

824
00:49:32.034 --> 00:49:33.200
蜘蛛俠
Spider-Man?

825
00:49:33.202 --> 00:49:35.802
嘿 剛才沒看到你
Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.

826
00:49:35.804 --> 00:49:37.204
Wow.

827
00:49:37.206 --> 00:49:39.373
好吧 我有點被嚇著了
Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now.

828
00:49:39.375 --> 00:49:41.208
我是說 你應該死了才對
You're supposed to be dead.

829
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:44.512
沒想到吧  好吧 這樣可不行 我不習慣那樣
Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no. We don't like that.

830
00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.280
真是太神奇了
This is fascinating.

831
00:49:46.282 --> 00:49:48.048
好吧 那是我的臉
Okay, that's my face.

832
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.284
一個完全不同的彼得 帕克
An entirely different Peter Parker.

833
00:49:50.286 --> 00:49:53.119
好吧 有點小肚腩 可能是因為空間扭曲
Little bit of a gut, perhaps from dimensional warping.

834
00:49:53.121 --> 00:49:55.655
對 對 對 穿越前我比現在廋多了
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. I was way flatter before I warped.

835
00:49:55.657 --> 00:49:57.525
穿越時空似乎
Travel through the multiverse

836
00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.526
會造成細胞惡化
appears to have deteriorated the...

837
00:49:59.528 --> 00:50:01.597
接下去是什麼
What was the rest?!

838
00:50:03.132 --> 00:50:04.597
嘿 你多大了
Hey, how old are you?

839
00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:07.233
你看上去不超過35
'Cause you don't look a day over 35.

840
00:50:07.235 --> 00:50:09.804
他們都說我瘋了  他們說我瘋了
They said I was crazy! They said I was crazy!

841
00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.704
告訴他們你沒有瘋
You showed 'em you're not crazy.

842
00:50:11.706 --> 00:50:13.442
這可能會有點疼
This might pinch a little.

843
00:50:16.411 --> 00:50:18.412
我知道 我只需要取一些樣本
I know. I just need to get these samples.

844
00:50:18.414 --> 00:50:19.646
好吧
Okay.

845
00:50:19.648 --> 00:50:21.449
就不能整理下桌面嗎 女士
Organize your desktop, lady.

846
00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:24.420
體內的細胞正在發生衰變
Wow. Just complete cellular decay.

847
00:50:25.621 --> 00:50:27.387
從來沒見過這種情況
I've never seen anything like this.

848
00:50:27.389 --> 00:50:28.621
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

849
00:50:28.623 --> 00:50:30.557
把數據連窩端走
I'm just taking the whole thing.

850
00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:32.358
很明顯 你出故障了
And obviously you've been glitching.

851
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.496
故障 不 為什麼這麼說
"Glitchin'"? No. Why would you even say that?

852
00:50:35.498 --> 00:50:37.430
你在這個空間待太久了
If you stay in this dimension too long,

853
00:50:37.432 --> 00:50:39.099
你的身體正在瓦解
your body's gonna disintegrate.

854
00:50:39.101 --> 00:50:41.101
知道這會有多疼嗎 彼得 帕克
Do you know how painful that would be, Peter Parker?

855
00:50:41.103 --> 00:50:42.103
我不知道
I don't know.

856
00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:44.204
你根本想像不到
You can't imagine.

857
00:50:44.206 --> 00:50:46.240
而我迫不及待
And I, for one,

858
00:50:46.242 --> 00:50:48.045
想要見證那一刻
can't wait to watch.

859
00:50:50.146 --> 00:50:51.545
你叫什麼名字來著
What did you say your name was?

860
00:50:51.547 --> 00:50:53.416
埃利維亞 奧克塔維厄斯博士
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

861
00:51:01.724 --> 00:51:03.891
我猜你的朋友是不是都叫你章魚博士
Can I assume that your friends call you Doc Ock?

862
00:51:03.893 --> 00:51:06.327
我朋友都叫我麗芙
My friends actually call me Liv.

863
00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.762
我的敵人才叫我章魚博士
My enemies call me Doc Ock.

864
00:51:08.764 --> 00:51:10.331
這交給我 快跑
I got this! Run!

865
00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.398
你在和誰說話
Who are you talking to?

866
00:51:14.269 --> 00:51:17.271
-我能搞定  -你搞得定嗎 彼得
- I got it! - Oh, you "Got it," Peter?

867
00:51:19.275 --> 00:51:20.710
我穩得住 夥計
I got it handled, buddy!

868
00:51:22.577 --> 00:51:24.213
一切盡在掌握
Everything is fine!

869
00:51:26.815 --> 00:51:28.349
好吧 情況
Okay, this is

870
00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:30.351
-有點失控 -你廢話還真多
- a little bit bad. - You're chatty.

871
00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.221
快跑
Gotta go.

872
00:51:33.922 --> 00:51:36.525
我想我快堅持不住了
This is the moment that I'm losin' the fight.

873
00:51:38.693 --> 00:51:41.729
好吧 告訴你個好消息  我們不需要顯示器
Let me tell you the good news. We don't need the monitor.

874
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:44.231
彼得
Peter!

875
00:51:44.233 --> 00:51:47.901
你怎麼沒告訴我你還有個會隱身的朋友
You didn't tell me you had an invisible friend!

876
00:51:47.903 --> 00:51:49.836
把電腦給我好嗎 年輕人
Could you give me that back, young man?

877
00:51:49.838 --> 00:51:51.838
彼得
Peter!

878
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.277
這是私人財產
It's proprietary.

879
00:51:58.847 --> 00:52:00.648
Oh.

880
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.749
這種情況還是
This'd be a good time

881
00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:03.416
-隱身比較好 -沒錯
- to turn invisible. - Yep.

882
00:52:03.418 --> 00:52:06.619
好吧 那你怎麼還不隱身  挑一個麵包圈
Okay, not gonna turn invisible. Selecting a bagel.

883
00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:08.322
表現得自然一點
Act super normal.

884
00:52:08.324 --> 00:52:09.456
蜘蛛俠
Spider-Man?

885
00:52:09.458 --> 00:52:10.657
說來你也不信
You know, that's funny,

886
00:52:10.659 --> 00:52:12.358
-很多人都會認錯 -嘿
- I get that a lot. - Hey.

887
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.595
-蜘蛛俠  -嘿 舉起手
- Spider-Man? - Hey! Hands up!

888
00:52:14.597 --> 00:52:15.896
好了 交換一下 什麼
Now we do a switchy-switchy.

889
00:52:15.898 --> 00:52:17.298
給我回來
Get back here!

890
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.499
你們想去哪裏
Where do you think you're going?

891
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:20.534
-他偷了麵包圈 -準備好蕩起來
- He took a bagel! - Time to swing,

892
00:52:20.536 --> 00:52:22.903
-就像我教你的那樣  -你什麼時候教過我
- just like I taught ya. - When did you teach me that?

893
00:52:22.905 --> 00:52:25.505
也對 我只是開個玩笑 曾進感情
I didn't. It's a little joke for team-building.

894
00:52:25.507 --> 00:52:27.273
嘿
Hey!

895
00:52:27.275 --> 00:52:29.476
-準備好了嗎 -當然沒有
- All right, you ready? - Of course I'm not ready!

896
00:52:31.347 --> 00:52:32.713
我還做不到
I can't do this yet!

897
00:52:32.715 --> 00:52:34.782
大家都知道 一個人在生死關頭
Everybody knows that the best way to learn

898
00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.820
可以做到許多本來做不到的事
is under intense life-threatening pressure.

899
00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:41.791
拜託 拜託
Come on, come on, come on.

900
00:52:45.728 --> 00:52:47.297
Uh-oh.

901
00:52:52.668 --> 00:52:54.668
你在下面做什麼
What are you doing down there?

902
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.570
我跑的得比蕩的快
I run better than I swing.

903
00:52:56.572 --> 00:52:59.673
你得蕩起來 不然他們會抓住你的
You gotta swing or they'll catch you.

904
00:52:59.675 --> 00:53:01.941
這就是你想學的
This is what you wanted.

905
00:53:07.516 --> 00:53:08.918
Uh-oh.

906
00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:16.523
快回來 小傢伙
Come back, little boy.

907
00:53:16.525 --> 00:53:18.891
以胯部為準線 瞄準目標位置
Aim with your hips! Look where you want it to hit.

908
00:53:18.893 --> 00:53:21.362
肩膀放平 別忘了後續動作
Square your shoulders. Don't forget to follow through!

909
00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.829
重心在後腳時不要發射
Don't shoot off your back foot.

910
00:53:22.831 --> 00:53:25.532
-太多了記不住  -那就別管我說的
- That's too many things! - Then stop listening to me!

911
00:53:25.534 --> 00:53:28.605
這是你今天給的最有用的建議
That's the best idea you've had all day!

912
00:53:35.677 --> 00:53:38.214
漂亮 邁爾斯
Nice, Miles!

913
00:53:41.416 --> 00:53:43.349
很好 你做到了
Good. You're doin' it.

914
00:53:43.351 --> 00:53:45.952
輕按兩下鬆開 然後在發射一次
Double tap to release and thwip it out again.

915
00:53:45.954 --> 00:53:47.820
發射 然後鬆開
Thwip and release.

916
00:53:47.822 --> 00:53:51.057
-發射 鬆開  -發射 鬆開
- And thwip. Release. Thwip. - And release.

917
00:53:51.059 --> 00:53:52.825
悟性不錯 發射 鬆開
You're a natural. Thwip. Release.

918
00:53:52.827 --> 00:53:55.561
-找到節奏了嗎 -發射再鬆開
- Feel the rhythm? - Thwip. And release!

919
00:53:55.563 --> 00:53:56.764
很不錯 邁爾斯
Good, Miles.

920
00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:58.865
我想說 你超級酷的 夥計
I gotta say, you're amazing, man.

921
00:53:58.867 --> 00:54:00.400
我們是團隊了
We're a little team!

922
00:54:00.402 --> 00:54:02.369
我是實力不減當年的老師
Me as the teacher who could still do it.

923
00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:05.405
你資質不錯 但和我當年比你還差點
You as the student who can do it, just not as good.

924
00:54:05.407 --> 00:54:08.244
真為我們驕傲  你有什麼想對我說的嗎
I'm proud of us. Is there something you want to say to me?

925
00:54:10.378 --> 00:54:11.347
彼得
Peter!

926
00:54:23.826 --> 00:54:25.559
-搞什麼  -誰幹的
- What the...? - Who did that?

927
00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:53.454
嘿 夥計們
Hey, guys.

928
00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:54.588
格溫達
Gwanda?

929
00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:56.389
是格溫才對
It's Gwen, actually.

930
00:54:56.391 --> 00:54:59.360
你認識她 真是不錯
Oh, you know her. Very cool.

931
00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:01.128
我來自另一個宇宙
I'm from another dimension.

932
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.365
我是說除了另一個還有一個
I mean, another-another dimension.

933
00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:07.034
好吧 各位 我們再從頭來一次
All right, people. Let's start at the beginning one last time.

934
00:55:07.036 --> 00:55:08.769
我叫格溫 史黛西
My name is Gwen Stacy.

935
00:55:08.771 --> 00:55:11.604
我被一隻受過輻射的蜘蛛咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

936
00:55:11.606 --> 00:55:13.407
在接下的兩年裏
And for the last two years,

937
00:55:13.409 --> 00:55:16.677
我成為了唯一的女蜘蛛俠
I've been the one and only Spider-Woman.

938
00:55:16.679 --> 00:55:18.612
剩下的你們都知道了
You guys know the rest.

939
00:55:18.614 --> 00:55:20.083
我加入了樂隊
I joined a band.

940
00:55:21.884 --> 00:55:23.586
救了我爸爸
Saved my dad.

941
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.389
可是卻沒能救下我最好的朋友
I couldn't save my best friend,

942
00:55:29.391 --> 00:55:30.859
彼得 帕克
Peter Parker,

943
00:55:32.561 --> 00:55:34.762
所以我發誓要救其他人
so now I save everyone else.

944
00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:37.697
於是我決定再也不交朋友了
And I don't do friends anymore,

945
00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:39.335
避免一切干擾
just to avoid any distractions.

946
00:55:40.835 --> 00:55:45.037
突然有一天 奇怪的事發生了
And one day this weird thing happened.

947
00:55:45.039 --> 00:55:48.110
這次的情況真的很奇怪
And I mean, like, really weird.

948
00:55:53.715 --> 00:55:56.385
我穿越到了上個星期
I was blown into last week.

949
00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.921
一點都不誇張
Literally.

950
00:56:01.923 --> 00:56:05.559
我回到了紐約 可不是我的紐約
I landed in New York, but not my New York.

951
00:56:06.862 --> 00:56:08.528
幸運的是
Lucky for these folks,

952
00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.798
蜘蛛俠出現了
Spider-Man was there to save the day.

953
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.967
我的蜘蛛直覺告訴我得去願景學校
My Spider-sense told me to head to Visions Academy.

954
00:56:13.969 --> 00:56:15.969
是你們早到了
...you guys are early.

955
00:56:15.971 --> 00:56:19.005
我也不知道為什麼 知道遇上了你
Wasn't sure why until I met you.

956
00:56:19.007 --> 00:56:19.942
Oh!

957
00:56:20.909 --> 00:56:22.175
我喜歡你的髮型
I like your haircut.

958
00:56:22.177 --> 00:56:24.077
你還好意思說
You don't get to like my haircut.

959
00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:25.579
我們走
Let's go.

960
00:56:25.581 --> 00:56:26.914
到底有多少蜘蛛俠
How many more Spider-People are there?

961
00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.081
自己去動漫展上看把
Save it for Comic-Con.

962
00:56:28.083 --> 00:56:30.184
動漫展是什麼
What's Comic-Con? Whoa!

963
00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:48.735
受死吧 蜘蛛俠
You're dead, Spider-Man.

964
00:56:48.737 --> 00:56:50.938
威爾遜 你在做什麼
Wilson! What are you doing?

965
00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.104
瓦娜沙
Vanessa.

966
00:56:52.106 --> 00:56:53.476
理查德 快走
Richard, come on.

967
00:56:57.045 --> 00:56:58.912
瓦娜沙 理查德
Vanessa! Richard!

968
00:56:58.914 --> 00:57:00.546
不
No!

969
00:57:00.548 --> 00:57:03.115
別往後看 親愛的  沒事的 沒事的
Don't look back, honey. It's okay. It's okay.

970
00:57:21.936 --> 00:57:23.903
我明明殺了蜘蛛俠
I killed Spider-Man.

971
00:57:23.905 --> 00:57:25.972
為什麼又多出來兩個
Why did I just see two more?

972
00:57:25.974 --> 00:57:28.242
準確的說是三個
There's three, actually.

973
00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:31.278
這是好事 非常非常好
No, this is good. This is very, very good.

974
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.979
這意味著你的目的達到了
This means you get what you want.

975
00:57:32.981 --> 00:57:36.148
我的對撞機起作用了
It means my collider works.

976
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:39.619
現在我們要做的就是滅掉那幾隻蜘蛛
All we have to do is kill a couple of Spiders.

977
00:57:39.621 --> 00:57:42.289
然後你的家人就能回到你的身邊
And the collider will bring your family back.

978
00:57:42.291 --> 00:57:44.894
想要多少就有多少
As many families as you want.

979
00:57:53.869 --> 00:57:56.836
明天啟動我的對撞機
Tomorrow, at my collider.

980
00:57:56.838 --> 00:57:58.907
是我們的對撞機
Our collider.

981
00:58:02.143 --> 00:58:03.677
是他弄壞的嗎
He broke this?

982
00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:06.213
對 他也覺得很不好意思
Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed about it,

983
00:58:06.215 --> 00:58:08.315
所以就當沒這回事好嗎
so just keep it between us, okay?

984
00:58:09.717 --> 00:58:11.552
我知道哪裏能做個新的
I know where we can make a new one.

985
00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:13.753
這次不會再讓他弄壞了
And we won't let him break it this time.

986
00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:17.961
你朋友的事我很遺憾
I'm sorry about your friend.

987
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:20.860
謝謝你 邁爾斯
Thanks, Miles.

988
00:58:23.097 --> 00:58:24.898
我知道這有多艱難
I know how hard this is.

989
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.601
要一個人面對這一切
To have to figure this stuff out on your own.

990
00:58:27.603 --> 00:58:30.771
知道自己不是一個人感覺還不錯
It's kinda nice not being the only Spider-person around.

991
00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.171
是啊
Yeah.

992
00:58:33.608 --> 00:58:36.008
如果哪天你願意交朋友了
If you ever decide to do friends again,

993
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:37.746
我可以給你留個位置
I could always open up a slot.

994
00:58:39.114 --> 00:58:41.914
到時候我會告訴你的
I'll keep you posted.

995
00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:43.952
好的
Cool.

996
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.590
不如我們還是走吧
We should probably go.

997
00:58:50.592 --> 00:58:52.925
彼得 都已經到門口了
Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.

998
00:58:52.927 --> 00:58:54.827
太糟了 這主意太遭了
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

999
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:56.362
放輕鬆
Just relax.

1000
00:58:56.364 --> 00:58:58.164
感謝你們的關心
You guys are all very sweet,

1001
00:58:58.166 --> 00:59:00.633
但今天不接待粉絲了 謝謝
but no more fans today, please.

1002
00:59:03.972 --> 00:59:05.639
我還沒心理準備
I'm not ready for this.

1003
00:59:10.311 --> 00:59:11.880
彼得
Peter?

1004
00:59:13.748 --> 00:59:15.749
嘿 梅嬸嬸
Hey, Aunt May.

1005
00:59:15.751 --> 00:59:17.784
我知道這聽起來有些瘋狂
So this is gonna sound crazy,

1006
00:59:17.786 --> 00:59:20.253
不過 我其實是來自
but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an...

1007
00:59:20.255 --> 00:59:22.255
另一個時空
An alternate dimension.

1008
00:59:22.257 --> 00:59:23.559
沒錯
Yeah.

1009
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.927
你看起來很累 彼得
You look tired, Peter.

1010
00:59:26.929 --> 00:59:29.128
好吧 確實很累
Well, I am tired.

1011
00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:32.298
-有點蒼老 而且還豐滿了  -對 已經有人說了
- And older. And thicker. - Yeah. I've heard that already.

1012
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.834
天啊 這個是寬鬆褲嗎
Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants?

1013
00:59:34.836 --> 00:59:37.070
沒錯 就是寬鬆褲
Yup, that's what they are.

1014
00:59:37.072 --> 00:59:38.972
彼得走的時候
I was there,

1015
00:59:38.974 --> 00:59:41.340
我就在現場
when it all happened.

1016
00:59:41.342 --> 00:59:43.409
我真的很抱歉
I am so sorry.

1017
00:59:43.411 --> 00:59:45.679
你又是從哪個空間來的
And what dimension are you from?

1018
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:47.748
布魯克林
Brooklyn.

1019
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:51.017
彼得有沒有什麼地方能讓我們重做一下這個
Did Peter have a place where we could make another one of these?

1020
00:59:51.019 --> 00:59:52.822
是小玩意
A goober.

1021
00:59:54.088 --> 00:59:55.287
跟我來
Follow me.

1022
00:59:58.427 --> 01:00:00.693
好吧 我也有這麼個地方
Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too.

1023
01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:02.963
存放裝備的小屋子
A little, old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.

1024
01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:17.346
這地方也太能裝了
I mean, this place is pretentious.

1025
01:00:24.452 --> 01:00:26.221
Whoa.

1026
01:00:30.858 --> 01:00:32.758
夥計 你那裏也和這裏一樣
Dude. Was yours anything like this?

1027
01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.061
差不多吧
Mine was like this,

1028
01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:36.128
不過沒有吉普和飛機
but take away the jeep, the plane.

1029
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:39.932
想像一下是這的縮小版 再多個床墊
Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.

1030
01:00:39.934 --> 01:00:42.304
現在的年輕人真是的
I feel sad for this guy.

1031
01:00:56.284 --> 01:00:57.386
嘿 彼得
Hey, Peter.

1032
01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.887
這不是斗篷嗎
I think this is a cape.

1033
01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:20.440
彼得知道他的使命有多危險
Peter knew how dangerous the job was.

1034
01:01:20.442 --> 01:01:23.209
可他也知道這世上唯一能阻止那傢伙的
But he figured the only one who could stop this guy

1035
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:24.947
只有蜘蛛俠
was Spider-Man.

1036
01:01:26.414 --> 01:01:28.380
金並知道我們會去找他
Kingpin knows we're coming.

1037
01:01:28.382 --> 01:01:30.349
可惜我們寡不敵眾
We're going to be outnumbered.

1038
01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:32.753
那可不一定
Don't be so sure.

1039
01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.791
你們可能會用到這個
You might need these.

1040
01:01:39.393 --> 01:01:42.297
你們以為只有你們想到要來這裏嗎
You think you're the only people who thought to come here?

1041
01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:46.298
嘿 夥計們
Hey, fellas.

1042
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.001
他是黑白的嗎
Is he in black and white?

1043
01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:50.403
哪裏來的風 這裏可是地下室
Where's that wind coming from? We're in a basement.

1044
01:01:50.405 --> 01:01:52.204
不管到哪裏 冷風總是相隨
Wherever I go, the wind follows.

1045
01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:55.077
而這風 終將幻化成雨
And the wind, it smells like rain.

1046
01:01:56.177 --> 01:01:57.177
大家好
Hi, guys!

1047
01:02:02.317 --> 01:02:04.784
你們好嗎 很高興認識你們
This could literally not get any weirder.

1048
01:02:04.786 --> 01:02:07.554
敢不敢再詭異一點
It can get weirder.

1049
01:02:07.556 --> 01:02:10.860
我剛洗了手 所以它才是濕的
I just washed my hands. That's why they're wet.

1050
01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.929
沒別的原因
No other reason.

1051
01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:22.270
你們和我一樣
You're like me.

1052
01:02:25.239 --> 01:02:26.472
我叫彼得 帕克

1054
01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:30.142
我叫彼得 波克
My name is Peter Porker.

1055
01:02:30.144 --> 01:02:31.912
我被一隻受過輻射的蜘蛛(豬)咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

1056
01:02:33.315 --> 01:02:35.481
在我的宇宙 現在是1933年
In my universe, it's 1933,

1057
01:02:35.483 --> 01:02:37.083
我是名私家偵探
and I'm a private eye.

1058
01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.418
我愛喝布魯克林特飲 蛋密乳
I like to drink egg creams,

1059
01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.854
也喜歡打擊納粹 非常喜歡
and I like to fight Nazis. A lot.

1060
01:02:40.856 --> 01:02:42.988
我來自3145年的紐約
I'm from New York in the year 3145.

1061
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:44.590
我爸的機器人裏住著一隻蜘蛛
I have a psychic link with a spider

1062
01:02:44.592 --> 01:02:46.392
我和它有心靈感應
who lives inside my father's robot.

1063
01:02:46.394 --> 01:02:49.028
我們是一輩子的好朋友
And we're best friends. Forever.

1064
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:51.097
有時我會讓火柴一直燃燒到指尖
Sometimes I let matches burn down to my fingertips

1065
01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:52.465
只是為了能有點感覺
just to feel something, anything.

1066
01:02:53.835 --> 01:02:54.867
我是嗥叫日報
I'm a photographer

1067
01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:55.969
的攝影師
for the Daily Beagle.

1068
01:02:55.971 --> 01:02:57.070
工作時間
When I'm not pooching around,

1069
01:02:57.072 --> 01:02:58.505
我會像狗狗一樣
I'm working like a dog,

1070
01:02:58.507 --> 01:02:59.840
到處挖掘勁爆新聞
trying to sniff out the latest story.

1071
01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:00.974
我唱歌 我跳舞
♪ I frolic and I dance ♪

1072
01:03:00.976 --> 01:03:02.008
我邊跳邊扭屁股
♪ And I do this With my pants ♪

1073
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.610
好了 可以了
Okay! Enough!

1074
01:03:03.612 --> 01:03:06.880
那麼 你們是怎麼來的
So how did you get here?

1075
01:03:06.882 --> 01:03:09.050
好吧 這可就說來話長了
Well, it's kind of a long story.

1076
01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:15.354
或許也沒那麼長
Maybe not that long.

1077
01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:18.458
現在 我們只想回家
And now we're just trying to find a way home.

1078
01:03:20.295 --> 01:03:23.028
回家的唯一方法就是跳進那個對撞機
The only way home is back through that collider gizmo.

1079
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.363
唯一的問題就是
The only trouble is...

1080
01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:27.601
得有個人留下來毀了那機器
One of us has to stay behind and destroy it.

1081
01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.034
我留下來
- I'll do it. - I'll do it. - I'll do it.

1082
01:03:29.036 --> 01:03:31.438
不 你們不明白
No, no, no. You guys don't get it.

1083
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.242
不明白什麼
Don't get what?

1084
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.280
你們不能留在這裏  留在這裏 你們會死的
None of you can stay here. If you stay here, you'll die.

1085
01:03:41.282 --> 01:03:43.516
應該由我來關掉那機器
I'm the guy who's gonna turn it off.

1086
01:03:43.518 --> 01:03:47.354
我會等你們都會之後再動手
And I'm gonna get you all home before I do.

1087
01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:51.394
我答應過他的 所以我必須做到
Look, I made a promise. So I have to keep it.

1088
01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:57.496
你是哪位
Who are you again?

1089
01:03:57.498 --> 01:03:58.898
他是邁爾斯
This is Miles.

1090
01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.467
他將會拯救平行宇宙
And he's gonna save the multiverse.

1091
01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.934
對 沒錯
Yeah, man.

1092
01:04:01.936 --> 01:04:03.536
這小子會隱身術
This kid can turn himself invisible.

1093
01:04:03.538 --> 01:04:05.070
看好了  他現在就能隱身
Watch this. He can do it now.

1094
01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:10.644
-我不能說隱身就隱身  -他不能說隱身就隱身
- I can't do it on command. - He can't do it on command.

1095
01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:13.412
但還是很酷  讓他們看看電擊 邁爾斯
But it is cool. Show 'em the zappy thing, Miles.

1096
01:04:15.217 --> 01:04:18.517
-我不能說來就來 -他不能說來就來
- Can't do it on command. - He can't do it on command.

1097
01:04:18.519 --> 01:04:21.054
但他還有其他技能  比如什麼來著
But he can do so much more. What else do you do?

1098
01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:23.956
只有這兩樣
- Just those two things. - Just those two things.

1099
01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:25.458
夥計
Aw, man.

1100
01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:30.066
聽著 我見過他的技能 他很有潛力
Look, I've seen him in action. He's got potential.

1101
01:04:31.233 --> 01:04:33.436
我想他能送我們回家
I think he's gonna get us home.

1102
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:36.635
好吧 年輕人

拜託 邁爾斯 站起來

1128
01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.463
你不能自欺欺人
You need to be more honest with yourself about this.

1129
01:05:37.465 --> 01:05:38.697
他還沒準備好 這很明顯
He's not ready. It's obvious.

1130
01:05:38.699 --> 01:05:40.367
行不通 他只是個孩子
There's no way. He's just a kid.

1131

我們就得留下替他完成任務

他在哪裏聽的到我們說他
He's looking right at us while we talk about him.

1134

Nobody's heard from you. We don't know what's going on.

你不可能每次都救得了所有人

1243
01:17:20.935 --> 01:17:25.170
這都是我的錯 你們不會理解
Look, it was my fault. You wouldn't understand.

1244
01:17:25.172 --> 01:17:28.210
邁爾斯 我們或許是這世上唯一能夠理解你的人
Miles, we're probably the only ones who do understand.

What about MJ?

不是所有的事情都會有結果
Not everything works out, kid.

1266
01:18:33.039 --> 01:18:35.508
我需要小玩意
I need the goober.

1267
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.343
請不要逼我從你那裏搶過來
Please don't make me take it from you.

1268
01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.510
這不公平
That's not fair!

1269
01:18:38.512 --> 01:18:40.379
你去告訴他們我能做到
You gotta tell them I can do this.

1270
01:18:40.381 --> 01:18:41.983
這不是他們的決定
It wasn't their decision.

1271
01:18:45.485 --> 01:18:49.021
我要讓金並付出代價  你必須讓我回去報仇
I gotta make Kingpin pay! You have to let me make him pay!

1272
01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:50.555
你這樣就等於去送死
Miles, you're gonna get yourself killed.

1273
01:18:50.557 --> 01:18:52.223
可我準備好了 我保證
But I'm ready. I promise!

1274
01:18:55.262 --> 01:18:57.329
那你現在就來電我
Then venom-strike me right now.

1275
01:18:57.331 --> 01:19:02.101
或者隱藏自己 說隱身就隱身 然後從我身邊走過
Or turn invisible on command so you can get past me.

1276
01:19:12.546 --> 01:19:16.080

可憐的小傢伙
Poor little guy.

1278
01:19:21.521 --> 01:19:23.824
可你還沒準備好
But you don't have it yet.

1279
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:30.499
對不起
I'm sorry.

彼得 怎麼才知道自己準備好了
When will I know I'm ready?

1281
01:19:35.869 --> 01:19:38.469
你不會知道 這是種信念
You won't. It's a leap of faith.

1282
01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:40.572
就這麼簡單 邁爾斯

把門打開好嗎
Please open the door.

Miles, I can see your shadow movin' around.

1288
01:20:37.131 --> 01:20:41.267
好吧 也對 我能理解 你還在生我的氣
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it. You're still ignoring me.

1289
01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.538
我們能聊幾句嗎
Look, can we talk for a minute?

1290
01:20:45.305 --> 01:20:47.174
有件事
Something...

1291
01:20:49.076 --> 01:20:51.078
有件事
Something happened to...

1292
01:20:53.914 --> 01:20:57.319
有時候人與人之間會變得疏遠
Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles.

1293
01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:02.955
我不希望這發生在我們身上 好嗎
And I don't want that to happen to us, okay?

1294
01:21:02.957 --> 01:21:05.257
我知道我一直沒能按照你希望的方式和你相處
I know I don't always do what you need me to do

1295
01:21:05.259 --> 01:21:07.596
可我看得到你身上的閃光點
or say what you need me to say.

1296
01:21:09.697 --> 01:21:15.500
這很了不起 所以我才會逼你
I see this spark in you. It's amazing. It's why I push you.

1297

你需要我的時候 我沒能出現
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.

1364

我甚至都沒盡力
- Mm-hmm. - I didn't even try.

For you, they should fill this place up with fresh bread.

風險太高了
It's too risky.

1411

還挺刺激的
That was crazy.

1442
01:32:47.127 --> 01:32:49.059
這都是我們教他的 對吧
We taught him that, right?

1443
01:32:49.061 --> 01:32:51.832
我可沒教過他 更不可能是你教的
I didn't teach him that. And you definitely didn't.

1444
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.118

我想說 我愛你們大家

我會把這小方塊帶回去
I'm taking this cube thing with me.

1456
01:33:58.931 --> 01:34:00.999

I don't understand it.

1457
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:02.636
但我會搞懂的
But I will.

1458

這個送給你
I want you to have this.

1459

朋友們 就到這裏吧

現在能說我喜歡你的髮型了嗎

15 months, but it's pretty significant if you ask me.

1465
01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:32.263

你不會知道
You won't.

1485

對
Right.

1486
01:35:46.338 --> 01:35:48.274
這是種信念
It's a leap of faith.

1487
01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:59.386
真不賴 小子
Not bad, kid.

1488

Not so easy doing it on your own, is it?

1495

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:31.171
真正的蜘蛛俠都戰勝不了我
The real Spider-Man couldn't even beat me.

1511
01:38:33.573 --> 01:38:35.276
你算什麼
You're nothing!

1512
01:38:41.314 --> 01:38:43.550
你奪走了我的家人
You took my family.

1513
01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:51.491
現在 我要讓你也見不到你的家人
And now I'm gonna make sure you never see yours again.

1514
01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:13.013
站起來 蜘蛛俠
Get up, Spider-Man.

1515
01:39:15.347 --> 01:39:17.984
站起來 蜘蛛俠
Get up! Come on!

1516
01:39:24.524 --> 01:39:28.061
拜託 拜託 拜託
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1517
01:39:39.204 --> 01:39:42.373
我不會離開我的家人
I'll always have my family.

1518
01:39:42.375 --> 01:39:44.110
聽過搭肩膀這招嗎
You ever hear of the shoulder touch?

1519
01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:46.313
什麼
What?

1520
01:39:50.483 --> 01:39:51.648
嘿
Hey.

1521
01:40:01.226 --> 01:40:05.431
嘿 金並 幫我按綠色按鈕
Hey, Kingpin! Push the green button for me!

1522
01:41:54.407 --> 01:41:57.407
邁爾斯 邁爾斯 你沒事吧
Miles? Miles? Are you okay?

1523
01:41:57.409 --> 01:41:58.511
放心 我沒事
Yeah, I'm okay.

1524
01:41:59.479 --> 01:42:00.745
你現在應該很忙 所以
You're probably busy...

1525
01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:02.780
不 我有空 我有空
No! I can talk, I can talk.

1526
01:42:02.782 --> 01:42:06.653
我之前去找你是因為
Look, so I came by earlier because...

1527
01:42:07.886 --> 01:42:10.323
-你叔叔 他 -我知道 爸爸
- Your uncle... - I know, Dad.

1528
01:42:11.623 --> 01:42:13.191
我很難過
I am so sorry.

1529
01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:15.259
我知道
Yeah.

1530
01:42:15.261 --> 01:42:16.727
知道是誰幹的嗎
Do you know who did it?

1531
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:18.562
我以為我知道
I thought I did.

1532
01:42:18.564 --> 01:42:20.697
可我錯了
But I was wrong.

1533
01:42:20.699 --> 01:42:24.268
聽著 邁爾斯 我在門口說的那些
Look, Miles, what I said at the door,

1534
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:25.639
不只是說說而已
it wasn't just talk.

1535
01:42:27.539 --> 01:42:29.706
聽著 知道嗎 我在想我們可以
Look, you know, I was thinking

1536
01:42:29.708 --> 01:42:32.410
找一堵不錯的牆
maybe we could find a nice wall,

1537
01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:35.545
私人所有的 比如警察局那堵
privately owned, like at the police station,

1538
01:42:35.547 --> 01:42:41.751
這樣你就可以把你的作品 "丟到"牆上去了
and you could "Throw up" Some of your art.

1539
01:42:41.753 --> 01:42:44.287
我實在不擅長說這些
Man, I'm bad at this.

1540
01:42:44.289 --> 01:42:47.424
好吧 邁爾斯 邁爾斯 還在嗎
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

1541
01:42:47.426 --> 01:42:50.361
真是的 什麼破信號
Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!

1542
01:42:50.363 --> 01:42:53.263
-警官 -蜘蛛俠
- Officer. - Spider-Man!

1543
01:42:53.265 --> 01:42:55.566
我想說 剛才真是
Listen, down there, that was...

1544
01:42:55.568 --> 01:42:57.300
我是說我欠你一個
I mean, I owe you...

1545
01:42:57.302 --> 01:42:59.506
好吧
Okay!

1546
01:43:07.279 --> 01:43:09.379
很期待和你並肩作戰
I look forward to workin' with you.

1547
01:43:09.381 --> 01:43:11.816
對 我想我也是
Yeah, me, too. I guess.

1548
01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:14.986
雖然我不贊成你的方式
I don't approve of your methods,

1549
01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:18.455
不過想法不同也許也能擦出火花
but we're just gonna have to agree to disagree.

1550
01:43:18.457 --> 01:43:21.424
感謝你今晚的英勇行為
Thank you for your bravery tonight.

1551
01:43:21.426 --> 01:43:22.660
我愛你
I love you.

1552
01:43:22.662 --> 01:43:24.262
等等 什麼
Wait, what?

1553
01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:25.396
看看你身後
And look behind you!

1554
01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.576
沒錯 是很酷 對
All right. Cool. Yeah.

1555
01:43:38.578 --> 01:43:39.977
謝謝你 蜘蛛俠
Thanks, Spider-Man.

1556
01:43:39.979 --> 01:43:41.812
蜘蛛俠 謝謝 謝謝
Spider-Man, a su servicio. Thank you.

1557
01:43:41.814 --> 01:43:43.446
嘿 夥計 你好嗎
Hey, man. What's up, little man?

1558
01:43:43.448 --> 01:43:44.648
是新蜘蛛俠
New Spider-Man.

1559
01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:45.915
對 沒錯 我是新蜘蛛俠
Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man.

1560
01:43:45.917 --> 01:43:47.485
看好了
Check it out.

1561
01:43:47.487 --> 01:43:48.818
Whoa!

1562
01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.488
剛才那是設計好的
That was part of the move.

1563
01:43:51.490 --> 01:43:54.558
好了 我們最後再來一次
Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah?

1564
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.059
這次是真的最後一次
For real this time. This is it.

1565
01:43:56.061 --> 01:43:57.727
我叫邁爾斯 莫拉萊斯
My name is Miles Morales.

1566
01:43:57.729 --> 01:43:59.830
我被一隻受過輻射的蜘蛛咬了
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

1567
01:43:59.832 --> 01:44:01.464
於是就在最近
And for like two days,

1568
01:44:01.466 --> 01:44:03.467
我成為了這裏唯一的蜘蛛俠
I've been the one and only Spider-Man.

1569
01:44:03.469 --> 01:44:04.968
剩下的你們都知道了
I think you know the rest.

1570
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:06.439
我寫完了論文
I finished my essay.

1571
01:44:07.472 --> 01:44:09.576
救了不少人
Saved a bunch of people.

1572
01:44:11.043 --> 01:44:12.942
撞到過無人機
Got hit by a drone.

1573
01:44:12.944 --> 01:44:14.648
我和我爸完成了這個
I did this with my dad.

1574
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:18.252
最後來見見我的室友
Met my roommate. Finally.

1575
01:44:20.019 --> 01:44:23.387
在我爸爸永遠找不到的地方貼貼紙
Slapped a sticker where my dad's never gonna find it.

1576
01:44:23.389 --> 01:44:25.055
當我感到孤單
And when I feel alone,

1577
01:44:25.057 --> 01:44:27.728
感覺沒人能理解自己時
like no one understands what I'm going through,

1578
01:44:29.362 --> 01:44:31.361
我知道我的朋友們會懂我
I remember my friends who get it.

1579
01:44:37.869 --> 01:44:40.537
我從沒想過自己能夠做到這些
I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff.

1580
01:44:40.539 --> 01:44:42.042
可我做到了
But I can.

1581
01:44:43.643 --> 01:44:45.545
任何人都能戴上這個面具
Anyone can wear the mask.

1582
01:44:46.878 --> 01:44:49.048
你也可以做到
You could wear the mask.

1583
01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:53.987
如果以前你沒想過 希望現在可以
If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now.

1584
01:45:02.694 --> 01:45:03.796
因為我是蜘蛛俠
'Cause I'm Spider-Man.

1585
01:45:05.797 --> 01:45:08.566
但我不是唯一的
And I'm not the only one.

1586
01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:10.101

You're a bit late.

1816
01:55:32.024 --> 01:55:33.423
We can't all be everywhere at once.

1817
01:55:33.425 --> 01:55:35.258
Little text might've been nice.

1818
01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:37.027
I was gone for less than two hours. What happened?

1819
01:55:37.029 --> 01:55:39.095
Okay. I know what it looks like.

1820
01:55:39.097 --> 01:55:41.565
- But here's the good news. - Oh, here we go.

1821
01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:43.500
The multiverse didn't collapse.

1822
01:55:43.502 --> 01:55:45.268
- Oh, cool! - Little touch and go.

1823
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:46.769
But it worked out.

1824
01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:48.205
Great story. Did you finish the goober?

1825
01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:49.638
It's not a goober. It's a gizmo.

1826
01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.174
Do you always have to call me out?

1827
01:55:51.176 --> 01:55:52.375
It's just really frustrating and bums me out.

1828
01:55:52.377 --> 01:55:53.710
Don't get excited, Miguel.

1829
01:55:53.712 --> 01:55:55.211
- It's just a prototype. - Not excited.

1830
01:55:55.213 --> 01:55:56.479
But you could be the first person

1831
01:55:56.481 --> 01:55:58.447
to make an autonomous multiverse jump.

1832
01:55:58.449 --> 01:55:59.750
Or the last.

1833
01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.585
So we're just gonna roll the dice on this?

1834
01:56:01.587 --> 01:56:04.454
So, what you do you say, pal? Where you want to go first?

1835
01:56:04.456 --> 01:56:07.391
Let's start at the beginning one last time.

1836
01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:09.625
Earth '67.

1837
01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:13.696
- Whoa! - What the...?

1838
01:56:13.698 --> 01:56:15.331
I'm Spider-Man.

1839
01:56:15.333 --> 01:56:16.700
- I need you to come with me. - Who the heck are you?

1840
01:56:16.702 --> 01:56:19.236
I just told you... Listen. I'm from the future.

1841
01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:21.504
- How dare you point at me! - You were pointing first.

1842
01:56:21.506 --> 01:56:24.040
- It's rude to point. - You're being very rude.

1843
01:56:24.042 --> 01:56:26.076
Which one pointed first?

1844
01:56:26.078 --> 01:56:28.044
Spider-Man pointed first. Obviously.

1845
01:56:28.046 --> 01:56:29.745
- You're pointing at me right now. - I'm not pointing.

1846
01:56:29.747 --> 01:56:31.481
Look at your finger.

1847
01:56:31.483 --> 01:56:32.782
I'm pointing out your pointing, which is different.

1848
01:56:32.784 --> 01:56:34.418
You haven't seen pointing.

1849
01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.620
You're accusing me of pointing while you're...!

1849
01:56:37.305 --> 01:56:43.175
