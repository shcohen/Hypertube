00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.300
Okay, Hold on, don't shoot

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.700
-You see where it going?
-Hmmm

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.700
Okay, don't worry how they get there

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
They gonna look for you

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
You gonna do this way
Hmmmm... Hips here... Okay?''

7
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:31.800
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.853
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:35.035
How about now?
Can you see now?

10
00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:37.035
-Yeah
-How about now?

11
00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:38.670
All right.

12
00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:41.461
Ready? Three fingers.

13
00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:42.846
Nice!

14
00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:47.259
- Nice throw, kiddo!
- Go.

15
00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:51.199
Hey, you guys want mayo
or mustard, or both?

16
00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:53.723
Who wants mayo on a hotdog?

17
00:00:53.856 --> 00:00:57.147
Pardon your brothers. Two mustards, please!
Thanks, momma.

18
00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:58.367
Got it.

19
00:00:58.453 --> 00:01:00.728
Nate, mayo or mustard?

20
00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.760
I want ketchup.

21
00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:06.682
Mind your elbow...

22
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.815
Good job, Hawkeye!
Go get your arrow.

23
00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:17.794
Hey, guys. Enough practice.
Soup's on.

24
00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:21.289
All right. We're coming.
We're hungry.

25
00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:23.852
Lila, let's go.

26
00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:27.952
Lila?

27
00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:31.735
Honey?

28
00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:36.930
Babe?

30
00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:47.479
Babe?

31
00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:50.466
Babe?

32
00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:53.718
Boys!

33
00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:56.977
Boys?

34
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.192
Laura!

35
00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:45.877
You don't need to do that,

36
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.356
because you're just
holding the position.

37
00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:50.779
Come on.

38
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.325
That was close.

39
00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.710
That's a goal. We're
now one a-piece.

40
00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.436
I would like to try again.

41
00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:00.789
We're tied up.

42
00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.986
Feel the tension? It's fun.

43
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.770
That was terrible. Now you
have a chance to win.

44
00:03:07.184 --> 00:03:10.022
And you won. Congratulations.

45
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.773
Fair game.

46
00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:13.986
Good sport.

47
00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:16.598
You had fun?

48
00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:19.776
It was fun.

49
00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:44.283
This thing on?

50
00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:48.927
Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.

51
00:03:50.827 --> 00:03:52.719
If you find this recording...

52
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:57.331
don't post it, on social media.
It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.

53
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.388
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

54
00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:02.797
I don't even know
if you're still...

55
00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:04.961
Oh, God. I hope so...

56
00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:10.284
Today is day 21... uh, 22.

57
00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:14.081
You know, if it wasn't for
the existensial terror of

58
00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:16.246
staring into the
literal void of space,

59
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.435
I'd say, I'm feeling
more better today.

60
00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:22.683
The infection's run its course,
thanks to the blue meanie back there.

61
00:04:22.824 --> 00:04:25.599
Ohh You'd love her. Very practical.

62
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.021
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

63
00:04:33.036 --> 00:04:36.953
So the fuel cells were cracked during battle, and
we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge

64
00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:39.836
to buy ourselves, about,
48 hours of flight time.

65
00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:45.404
But it's now dead in the water.

66
00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:48.431
We're 1,000 lightyears
from the nearest 7-11.

67
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.950
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning.

68
00:04:53.976 --> 00:04:55.703
And That'll be it.

69
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.731
And Pep, I...

70
00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:03.171
I know I said no
more surprises, but

71
00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:06.432
I gotta say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.

72
00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:07.791
But it looks like...

73
00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:09.825
Well, you know what
it looks like.

74
00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:13.670
Don't feel bad about this.

75
00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:16.782
I mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks,

76
00:05:17.557 --> 00:05:20.092
and then, move on
with enormous guilt.

77
00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:28.950
I should probably lie down.
I'm gonna caress my *inaudible*

78
00:05:32.727 --> 00:05:34.580
Please know that...

79
00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.927
When I drift off, it will be like

80
00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:42.337
Lately... I'm fine
Totally fine

81
00:05:42.612 --> 00:05:44.292
I dreamed about you.

82
00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:47.105
Because it's always you.

83
00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:12.866
- Couldn't stop him.
- Neither could I.

84
00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:17.594
I lost the kid.

85
00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:22.268
Tony, we lost.

86
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:26.014
Is, uhm...

87
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:30.000
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

88
00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:36.569
It's okay.

89
00:09:43.373 --> 00:09:46.022
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.

90
00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:50.712
World governments are in pieces.

91
00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:54.364
The parts that are still working
are trying to take a census,

92
00:09:54.372 --> 00:09:56.286
And it looks like he did...

93
00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:02.884
He did exactly what he said he
was gonna do. Thanos wiped out..

94
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:07.473
...fifty percent of
all living creatures.

95
00:10:11.943 --> 00:10:13.639
Where is he now? Where?

96
00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:15.523
We don't know.

97
00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:18.977
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

98
00:10:21.597 --> 00:10:23.065
What's wrong with him?

99
00:10:23.605 --> 00:10:25.021
He's pissed.

100
00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.660
He thinks he failed.

101
00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:31.911
Which of course he did, but there's a
lot of that goin' around, ain't there?

102
00:10:32.084 --> 00:10:35.293
Honestly, at this exact second, I
thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

103
00:10:35.318 --> 00:10:36.282
Maybe I am.

104
00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:38.245
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

105
00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:41.972
Deep space scans, and
satellites, and we got nothing.

106
00:10:44.148 --> 00:10:46.618
- Tony you fought him.
- Who told you that?

107
00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:47.759
Didn't fight him.

108
00:10:47.837 --> 00:10:50.079
No. He wiped my face
with a planet while a

109
00:10:50.104 --> 00:10:52.450
While a Bleaker Street magician
gave away the stone.

110
00:10:52.528 --> 00:10:54.318
- That's what happened. There was no fight...
- Okay.

111
00:10:54.342 --> 00:10:54.900
He's a beep....

112
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.500
Did he give you any clues?
Any coordinates, anything?

113
00:10:58.745 --> 00:10:59.746
Pfft!

114
00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:04.029
I saw this coming a few years back. I had
a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

115
00:11:04.607 --> 00:11:06.045
Thought I was dreaming.

116
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.914
- Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.
- And I needed you.

117
00:11:09.212 --> 00:11:13.331
As in past tense. That trumps what
you need. It's too late, buddy.

118
00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:14.700
Sorry.

119
00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:18.420
You know what I need?
I need to shave.

120
00:11:19.227 --> 00:11:22.720
- And I believe I rememeber telling
- Tony, Tony, Tony...

121
00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:24.668
why that otherwise,

122
00:11:24.693 --> 00:11:29.150
that what we needed was a suit of armor
around the world. Remember that?

123
00:11:29.175 --> 00:11:33.623
Whether it impacted our precious
freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.

124
00:11:33.648 --> 00:11:36.189
- Well that didn't work out, did it?
- I said we'd lose.

125
00:11:36.302 --> 00:11:39.179
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."

126
00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:41.868
Well guess what, Cap? We lost.

127
00:11:41.907 --> 00:11:44.308
You weren't there.

128
00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:47.723
But that's what we do, right?
Our best work after the fact?

129
00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.991
We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?

130
00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:53.713
Okay. You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

131
00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:56.386
- No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.
- Tony, sit, sit down!

132
00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:58.842
We need you. You're new blood.
Bunch of tired old mills...

133
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.362
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,

134
00:12:02.387 --> 00:12:05.298
no clues, no strategies,
no options...

135
00:12:05.323 --> 00:12:09.282
Zero. Zip. Nada. No
trust, you liar...

136
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.654
Here, take this. You find
him and you put that on.

137
00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:18.797
You hide.

138
00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:23.340
- Tony!
- I'm fine. I...

139
00:12:30.675 --> 00:12:34.459
Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna
probably be out for the rest of the day.

140
00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:38.180
You guys take care of him. And I'll bring
an Bezurian elixir when I come back.

141
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:41.306
- Where are you going?
- To kill Thanos.

142
00:12:44.653 --> 00:12:45.293
Hey.

143
00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:48.038
You know we usually work
as a team here, and

144
00:12:48.087 --> 00:12:50.038
between you and I we're
also a little fragile.

145
00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:53.666
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight, too.

146
00:12:53.698 --> 00:12:56.214
- You even know where he is?
- I know people who might.

147
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.012
Don't bother.

148
00:12:58.598 --> 00:13:00.934
I can tell you where Thanos is.

149
00:13:03.109 --> 00:13:05.853
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

150
00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:10.354
Then when he worked, he
talked about his great plan.

151
00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:13.333
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.

152
00:13:13.888 --> 00:13:18.086
I'd ask, where would we go
once his plan was complete?

153
00:13:19.204 --> 00:13:21.272
His answer was always the same.

154
00:13:25.444 --> 00:13:26.570
To The Garden.

155
00:13:26.828 --> 00:13:29.861
That's cute. Thanos has
a retirement plan.

156
00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:31.535
So where is he, then?

157
00:13:31.598 --> 00:13:33.347
When Thanos snapped his fingers,

158
00:13:33.372 --> 00:13:37.906
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

159
00:13:37.953 --> 00:13:42.237
No one's ever seen anything like it...
until two days ago.

160
00:13:43.371 --> 00:13:45.668
On this planet.

161
00:13:45.998 --> 00:13:47.341
Thanos is there.

162
00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:50.656
He used the stones again.

163
00:13:50.992 --> 00:13:52.060
Hey, hey, hey...

164
00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:55.115
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?

165
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.594
- Look, he still got the stones, so...
- So let's get him.

166
00:13:58.072 --> 00:14:00.767
- We use them to bring everyone back.
- Just like that?

167
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.759
Yeah. Just like that.

168
00:14:02.784 --> 00:14:05.941
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

169
00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:08.724
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

170
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:12.994
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

171
00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:15.180
Because before, you
didn't have me.

172
00:14:15.508 --> 00:14:19.729
Hey, new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.

173
00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:22.688
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?

174
00:14:22.713 --> 00:14:25.261
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

175
00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:28.108
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.

176
00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:48.857
I like this one.

177
00:14:54.204 --> 00:14:56.823
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.

178
00:15:18.498 --> 00:15:22.289
Okay. Who here hasn't
been to space?

179
00:15:24.688 --> 00:15:26.916
You better not throw
up on my ship.

180
00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:30.512
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1

181
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.000
I'll head down for recon.

182
00:16:04.277 --> 00:16:07.122
- This is gonna work Steve.
- I know it will.

183
00:16:11.107 --> 00:16:13.734
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

184
00:16:13.976 --> 00:16:19.581
No satellites, no ships, no armies,
no ground defenses of any kind.

185
00:16:21.144 --> 00:16:22.457
It's just him.

186
00:16:23.466 --> 00:16:25.217
Then that's enough.

187
00:17:54.701 --> 00:17:55.974
Oh, no.

188
00:18:05.814 --> 00:18:07.150
Where are they?

189
00:18:07.393 --> 00:18:09.832
Answer the question.

190
00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:14.138
The universe
required correction.

191
00:18:14.234 --> 00:18:19.506
After that, the stones served
no purpose, beyond temptation.

192
00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:21.351
You murdered trillions!

193
00:18:22.624 --> 00:18:24.312
You should be grateful.

194
00:18:28.214 --> 00:18:31.270
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

195
00:18:31.853 --> 00:18:35.356
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

196
00:18:35.434 --> 00:18:38.561
I used the stones to
destroy the stones.

197
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.047
It nearly killed me.

198
00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:46.378
But the work is done.
It always will be.

199
00:18:48.922 --> 00:18:52.306
I am inevitable.

200
00:18:54.354 --> 00:18:56.895
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.

201
00:18:56.919 --> 00:18:58.586
My father is many things.

202
00:18:59.021 --> 00:19:01.585
A liar is not one of them.

203
00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:07.590
Thank you, Daughter.

204
00:19:09.152 --> 00:19:11.734
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

205
00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:21.084
-What?!?!?
-What did you do?

206
00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:24.899
I went for the head.

207
00:20:35.621 --> 00:20:36.942
So I, uh...

208
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:40.764
Went on a date the other day.

209
00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:45.711
It's the first time in five years,
you know? Sit there, dinner...

210
00:20:45.993 --> 00:20:48.596
I didn't know what
to talk about.

211
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.121
What did you talk about?

212
00:20:52.162 --> 00:20:55.398
Same old crap, you know? How
things have changed, and...

213
00:20:56.195 --> 00:20:57.696
My job, his job....

214
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.643
How much we miss the Mets.

215
00:21:03.082 --> 00:21:04.616
Then things get quiet..

216
00:21:06.562 --> 00:21:09.876
He cried as they were
serving the salads.

217
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.830
What about you?

218
00:21:13.175 --> 00:21:16.169
I cried just before dessert.

219
00:21:19.757 --> 00:21:22.759
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

220
00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:23.978
That's great.

221
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.965
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump, you

222
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.083
didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

223
00:21:28.567 --> 00:21:33.037
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps you gotta take.

224
00:21:33.047 --> 00:21:36.635
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.

225
00:21:38.707 --> 00:21:42.240
I went in the ice in '45 right
after I met the love of my life.

226
00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.602
Woke up 70 years later.

227
00:21:48.338 --> 00:21:49.643
You got to move on.

228
00:21:53.162 --> 00:21:54.468
Got to move on.

229
00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:01.723
The world is in our hands.

230
00:22:02.044 --> 00:22:03.998
It's left to us guys.

231
00:22:04.162 --> 00:22:06.789
And we got to do
something with it.

232
00:22:07.438 --> 00:22:08.758
Otherwise...

233
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.719
Thanos should've
killed all of us.

234
00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:16.112
What the hell?

235
00:23:27.927 --> 00:23:28.975
Hope?

236
00:24:02.553 --> 00:24:04.891
Kid! Hey, kid!

237
00:24:09.037 --> 00:24:11.351
What the hell happened here?

238
00:24:43.257 --> 00:24:44.336
My God...

239
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:52.067
No. Please. Please, please.
No, no, no...

240
00:24:58.117 --> 00:25:00.806
Excuse me. Sorry.
No, Cassie, no.

241
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.361
No.

242
00:25:03.386 --> 00:25:04.386
No, no.

243
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.036
Please, please,
please, please....

244
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:09.061
No, Cassie...

245
00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:17.309
What?

246
00:25:47.442 --> 00:25:48.732
Cassie?

247
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.030
Dad?

248
00:26:17.464 --> 00:26:18.902
You're so big!

249
00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:37.478
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.

250
00:26:37.503 --> 00:26:39.559
It was an infectious
garbage scowl.

251
00:26:39.584 --> 00:26:41.091
So, thanks for the hot tip.

252
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:43.952
- Well, you were closer.
- Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

253
00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:45.850
You get a reading
on those tremors?

254
00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:48.369
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.

255
00:26:48.488 --> 00:26:50.903
Do we have a visual? How
are we handling it?

256
00:26:50.934 --> 00:26:54.171
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.

257
00:26:54.203 --> 00:26:57.172
We handle it by not handling it.

258
00:26:57.954 --> 00:27:00.354
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

259
00:27:00.383 --> 00:27:03.434
- Not likely.
- What, you gonna get another haircut?

260
00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:07.097
Listen, fur-face. I'm
covering a lot of territory.

261
00:27:07.122 --> 00:27:08.998
The things that are
happening on Earth are

262
00:27:09.023 --> 00:27:11.891
happening everywhere, on
thousands of planets.

263
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.589
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

264
00:27:15.262 --> 00:27:17.944
So you might not see
me for a long time.

265
00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:20.108
All right. Uh, well...

266
00:27:20.748 --> 00:27:25.055
This channel is always active.
So, anything goes sideways...

267
00:27:25.126 --> 00:27:27.549
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

268
00:27:27.815 --> 00:27:30.699
- Comes through me.
- Okay.

269
00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:31.716
All right.

270
00:27:32.838 --> 00:27:34.139
Good luck.

271
00:27:42.484 --> 00:27:44.829
- Where are you?
- Mexico.

272
00:27:44.882 --> 00:27:47.839
The federales found a
room full of bodies.

273
00:27:48.082 --> 00:27:51.669
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never
even had the chance to get their guns off.

274
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.109
- It's probably a rival gang...
- Except it isn't.

275
00:27:55.134 --> 00:27:57.516
It's definitely Barton.

276
00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:02.029
What he's done here, what he's
been doing for the last few years,

277
00:28:03.622 --> 00:28:05.685
I mean, the scene
that he left...

278
00:28:06.256 --> 00:28:09.563
I gotta tell you, there's a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.

279
00:28:15.399 --> 00:28:17.735
Will you find out where
he's going next?

280
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.701
Nat...

281
00:28:24.262 --> 00:28:25.467
Please.

282
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.101
Okay.

283
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.992
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already.

284
00:28:45.762 --> 00:28:47.152
You here to do your laundry?

285
00:28:47.177 --> 00:28:49.099
And to see a friend.

286
00:28:49.984 --> 00:28:51.922
Clearly, your friend is fine.

287
00:28:55.257 --> 00:28:57.882
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.

288
00:28:57.907 --> 00:29:01.026
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

289
00:29:01.034 --> 00:29:05.091
You know, if you're about to tell
me to look on the bright side...

290
00:29:05.636 --> 00:29:06.637
Um...

291
00:29:07.747 --> 00:29:11.507
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

292
00:29:13.407 --> 00:29:16.244
Sorry. Force of habit.

293
00:29:30.107 --> 00:29:34.319
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and... grow.

294
00:29:36.469 --> 00:29:37.602
Some do.

295
00:29:41.175 --> 00:29:42.347
But not us.

296
00:29:43.213 --> 00:29:47.536
- If I move on, who does this?
- Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

297
00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:54.143
I used to have nothing.

298
00:29:55.292 --> 00:29:57.372
And then I got this.

299
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:00.960
This job.

300
00:30:03.823 --> 00:30:05.119
This family.

301
00:30:09.304 --> 00:30:12.985
And I was... I was
better because of it.

302
00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:20.811
And even though...

303
00:30:21.877 --> 00:30:23.346
they're gone...

304
00:30:26.998 --> 00:30:29.280
Now, I'm still
trying to be better.

305
00:30:32.598 --> 00:30:34.646
I think we both
need to get a life.

306
00:30:37.493 --> 00:30:38.734
You first.

307
00:30:43.926 --> 00:30:45.348
Oh... Hi. Hi!

308
00:30:45.372 --> 00:30:48.316
Is anyone home?
This is Scott Lang.

309
00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:52.992
We met a few years ago, at the airport?
In Germany?

310
00:30:53.024 --> 00:30:55.885
I got really big and
I had my mask on.

311
00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.831
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

312
00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:00.788
Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I
know you know that.

313
00:31:00.874 --> 00:31:01.898
It's the front gate.

314
00:31:01.929 --> 00:31:03.730
I need to talk to you guys.

315
00:31:09.598 --> 00:31:10.599
Scott.

316
00:31:11.943 --> 00:31:13.951
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

317
00:31:15.616 --> 00:31:18.173
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?

318
00:31:18.502 --> 00:31:20.619
Only in mid-conversation.

319
00:31:20.807 --> 00:31:21.808
Alright. So...

320
00:31:22.912 --> 00:31:27.570
Five years ago, right before...
Thanos,

321
00:31:27.673 --> 00:31:29.909
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

322
00:31:30.081 --> 00:31:32.950
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.

323
00:31:32.975 --> 00:31:36.516
To get in there, you have to be
incredibly small. Hope, she's my...

324
00:31:38.353 --> 00:31:39.870
She... she was my...

325
00:31:41.911 --> 00:31:45.615
She was supposed to pull me out.
And then Thanos happened, and

326
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.313
- I got stuck in there.
- Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.

327
00:31:49.339 --> 00:31:52.011
Yeah, but that's just it.
It wasn't.

328
00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:53.754
For me it was five hours.

329
00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:56.344
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

330
00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:00.822
Everything is unpredictable. Is that
anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.

331
00:32:01.135 --> 00:32:02.136
Scott.

332
00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:04.113
What are you talking about?

333
00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:05.206
So...

334
00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.106
What I'm saying is...

335
00:32:08.824 --> 00:32:11.176
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

336
00:32:11.264 --> 00:32:13.444
The only problem is right now, we
don't have a way to navigate it.

337
00:32:13.485 --> 00:32:14.829
But what if we did?

338
00:32:14.877 --> 00:32:18.604
I can't stop thinking about it. What
if we could somehow control the chaos,

339
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:22.113
and we could navigate it? What if
there was a way that we can enter

340
00:32:22.138 --> 00:32:24.585
the quantum realm at a certain
point in time but then

341
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.712
exit the quantum realm at
another point in time? Like...

342
00:32:28.992 --> 00:32:30.594
Like before Thanos.

343
00:32:30.797 --> 00:32:33.085
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?

344
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.232
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

345
00:32:36.381 --> 00:32:38.437
It's more like a...

346
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:43.179
Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy.
It's crazy.

347
00:32:43.743 --> 00:32:47.112
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...

348
00:32:47.487 --> 00:32:50.328
Some wa... It's crazy.

349
00:32:50.353 --> 00:32:54.301
I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,
nothing sounds crazy anymore.

350
00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:57.186
So who do we talk to about this?

351
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.250
Chow-time!

352
00:33:18.714 --> 00:33:19.715
Morgoona.

353
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.422
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?

354
00:33:26.602 --> 00:33:29.502
- Define lunch or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

355
00:33:30.511 --> 00:33:31.862
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

356
00:33:31.887 --> 00:33:34.770
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.

357
00:33:38.163 --> 00:33:40.367
There you go. Are you
thinking about lunch?

358
00:33:40.883 --> 00:33:43.040
Want a handful of crickets?

359
00:33:43.103 --> 00:33:44.947
- No.
- That's what you want.

360
00:33:44.972 --> 00:33:48.388
- How did you find this?
- Garage.

361
00:33:48.424 --> 00:33:49.197
Really?

362
00:33:49.222 --> 00:33:51.582
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

363
00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:53.778
I found it, though.

364
00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:57.295
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.

365
00:33:58.328 --> 00:34:01.278
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.

366
00:34:22.737 --> 00:34:25.071
Now, we know what
it sounds like...

367
00:34:25.144 --> 00:34:27.098
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...

368
00:34:27.122 --> 00:34:29.512
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,

369
00:34:29.537 --> 00:34:32.547
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?

370
00:34:32.704 --> 00:34:33.704
Thank you.

371
00:34:33.743 --> 00:34:36.401
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

372
00:34:36.426 --> 00:34:37.427
- I did.
- No.

373
00:34:37.465 --> 00:34:39.462
You accidentally survived. It's a---

374
00:34:39.509 --> 00:34:42.019
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

375
00:34:42.087 --> 00:34:43.855
And now you wanna pull a...

376
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.479
What do you call it?

377
00:34:47.198 --> 00:34:49.910
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.

378
00:34:50.184 --> 00:34:52.353
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?

379
00:34:52.378 --> 00:34:54.870
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?

380
00:34:54.895 --> 00:34:58.343
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.

381
00:34:58.368 --> 00:35:00.875
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

382
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.043
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

383
00:35:03.083 --> 00:35:04.309
I don't believe we would.

384
00:35:04.434 --> 00:35:07.748
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.

385
00:35:08.028 --> 00:35:11.045
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,

386
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:15.369
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.

387
00:35:15.862 --> 00:35:18.491
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

388
00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:21.525
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

389
00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:25.700
That means no talking to our past selves,
no betting on sporting events...

390
00:35:25.732 --> 00:35:28.264
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

391
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.890
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to

392
00:35:30.915 --> 00:35:34.017
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?

393
00:35:35.962 --> 00:35:38.041
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.

394
00:35:38.063 --> 00:35:41.338
'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's
not how quantum physics works.

395
00:35:41.591 --> 00:35:42.592
Tony...

396
00:35:44.593 --> 00:35:46.485
We have to take a stand.

397
00:35:46.884 --> 00:35:49.636
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.

398
00:35:51.074 --> 00:35:54.842
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.

399
00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:59.932
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.

400
00:36:00.025 --> 00:36:04.409
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.

401
00:36:04.434 --> 00:36:06.036
And you're telling me
that you won't even...

402
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:08.069
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.

403
00:36:09.687 --> 00:36:11.297
Got a kid.

404
00:36:13.143 --> 00:36:15.394
Mommy told me to
come and save you.

405
00:36:15.419 --> 00:36:18.067
Good job. I'm saved.

406
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.811
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.

407
00:36:20.827 --> 00:36:23.742
Anything else. Honestly, I
missed you guys, it was...

408
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:26.932
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.

409
00:36:27.049 --> 00:36:29.440
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

410
00:36:30.059 --> 00:36:32.020
But this is a second chance.

411
00:36:32.318 --> 00:36:34.757
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

412
00:36:34.856 --> 00:36:36.974
I can't roll the dice again.

413
00:36:38.464 --> 00:36:41.169
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

414
00:36:43.922 --> 00:36:46.495
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.

415
00:36:46.713 --> 00:36:48.940
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?

416
00:36:49.074 --> 00:36:51.207
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?

417
00:36:51.232 --> 00:36:53.139
No. I wanna do it right.

418
00:36:56.412 --> 00:36:58.594
We're gonna need a
really big brain.

419
00:36:58.945 --> 00:37:00.672
Bigger than his?

420
00:37:01.023 --> 00:37:03.853
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating. Try some of that.

421
00:37:03.878 --> 00:37:05.112
Have some eggs.

422
00:37:05.378 --> 00:37:06.660
I'm so confused.

423
00:37:06.688 --> 00:37:09.338
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...

424
00:37:09.362 --> 00:37:12.246
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.

425
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:15.679
I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.

426
00:37:15.804 --> 00:37:20.077
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?

427
00:37:20.217 --> 00:37:22.767
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.

428
00:37:23.236 --> 00:37:26.145
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.

429
00:37:26.388 --> 00:37:30.490
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.

430
00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:33.361
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.

431
00:37:34.928 --> 00:37:36.797
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's

432
00:37:36.822 --> 00:37:39.260
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.

433
00:37:40.035 --> 00:37:42.918
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.

434
00:37:42.986 --> 00:37:48.043
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.

435
00:37:48.184 --> 00:37:51.959
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.

436
00:37:52.166 --> 00:37:54.245
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?

437
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.881
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.

438
00:37:57.929 --> 00:38:00.727
Come on, step on up. You mind?

439
00:38:00.752 --> 00:38:01.753
Oh.

440
00:38:02.434 --> 00:38:05.061
- Say "green."
- Green.

441
00:38:05.086 --> 00:38:06.741
Greeeen.

442
00:38:06.766 --> 00:38:09.471
- Did you get that?
- That's good.

443
00:38:09.799 --> 00:38:12.809
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

444
00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:17.239
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

445
00:38:17.264 --> 00:38:19.452
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...

446
00:38:19.477 --> 00:38:22.001
You want to take a
picture with him, right?

447
00:38:22.026 --> 00:38:24.144
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.

448
00:38:24.169 --> 00:38:27.130
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.

449
00:38:27.132 --> 00:38:29.039
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

450
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.416
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.

451
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:33.949
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the goddamn phone.

452
00:38:35.066 --> 00:38:36.000
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

453
00:38:36.025 --> 00:38:38.303
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.

454
00:38:38.617 --> 00:38:40.774
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.

455
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.002
- Dab.
- Bruce.

456
00:38:43.027 --> 00:38:45.731
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.

457
00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:48.725
- About we were saying...
- Right.

458
00:38:50.638 --> 00:38:53.342
The whole time travel do-over?

459
00:38:54.756 --> 00:38:57.939
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

460
00:38:59.018 --> 00:39:00.901
Well, you pulled this off.

461
00:39:01.254 --> 00:39:04.709
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

462
00:39:38.236 --> 00:39:40.941
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.

463
00:39:41.227 --> 00:39:45.097
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.

464
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:49.725
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?

465
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.383
Processing...

466
00:39:54.549 --> 00:39:58.885
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.

467
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.608
- Gotta take a second.
- Just a moment.

468
00:40:02.029 --> 00:40:05.257
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

469
00:40:06.421 --> 00:40:08.532
Model rendered.

470
00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:20.785
Shit!

471
00:40:21.135 --> 00:40:22.136
Shit!

472
00:40:26.354 --> 00:40:28.261
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?

473
00:40:28.316 --> 00:40:30.121
- Shit.
- No. We don't say that.

474
00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:33.389
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.

475
00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:34.439
Why you up?

476
00:40:34.464 --> 00:40:37.091
'Cause I got some important shit
going on here. What do you think?

477
00:40:37.116 --> 00:40:40.255
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

478
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.267
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.

479
00:40:46.006 --> 00:40:48.147
That's extortion.

480
00:40:49.164 --> 00:40:53.017
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...

481
00:40:54.542 --> 00:40:55.894
my mind.

482
00:40:56.716 --> 00:40:59.889
You done? Yeah? Now you are.

483
00:41:05.244 --> 00:41:08.332
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.

484
00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.201
A story.

485
00:41:10.475 --> 00:41:13.008
Once upon a time, a little
girl went to bed. The end.

486
00:41:13.047 --> 00:41:14.378
That ain't the whole story.

487
00:41:14.403 --> 00:41:16.654
Come on, that's your
favorite story.

488
00:41:16.738 --> 00:41:18.207
I love you tons.

489
00:41:19.928 --> 00:41:22.452
I love you 3,000.

490
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360
Wow.

491
00:41:31.501 --> 00:41:34.526
3,000. That's crazy.

492
00:41:35.364 --> 00:41:37.898
Go to bed. Or I'll
sell all your toys.

493
00:41:38.232 --> 00:41:39.428
Night-night.

494
00:41:40.202 --> 00:41:43.876
Not that it's a competition,
but she loves me 3,000.

495
00:41:44.674 --> 00:41:48.574
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

496
00:41:54.215 --> 00:41:58.257
- What you reading?
- Just a book on composting.

497
00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:00.500
What's new with composting?

498
00:42:01.767 --> 00:42:03.401
- Just ....
- I figured it out...

499
00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:05.879
by the way.

500
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:09.661
You know, just so we're talking
about the same thing...

501
00:42:10.108 --> 00:42:11.491
Time travel.

502
00:42:12.624 --> 00:42:13.625
What?

503
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:18.090
Wow.

504
00:42:20.389 --> 00:42:21.389
That's...

505
00:42:22.163 --> 00:42:25.892
Amazing, and.... terrifying.

506
00:42:25.955 --> 00:42:27.135
That's right.

507
00:42:34.845 --> 00:42:39.044
- I got really lucky.
- Yeah. I know.

508
00:42:39.114 --> 00:42:42.241
- A lot of people didn't.
- No, I can't help everybody.

509
00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:46.482
- It sorta seems like you can.
- Not if I stop.

510
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.227
I can put a pin in it
right now, and stop.

511
00:42:51.586 --> 00:42:52.853
Tony...

512
00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:58.474
trying to get you to stop has been one
of the few failures of my entire life.

513
00:43:02.347 --> 00:43:07.967
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked
box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...

514
00:43:08.718 --> 00:43:10.562
...go to bed.

515
00:43:16.295 --> 00:43:18.805
But would you be able to rest?

516
00:43:23.307 --> 00:43:26.394
Okay, here we go. Time
travel test number one.

517
00:43:26.614 --> 00:43:31.312
Scott, fire up the, uhh...
The van thing.

518
00:43:33.221 --> 00:43:36.717
Breakers are set. Emergency
generators are on standby.

519
00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:41.595
Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't
wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.

520
00:43:41.689 --> 00:43:44.010
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

521
00:43:44.276 --> 00:43:46.096
You can't say things like that.

522
00:43:46.121 --> 00:43:49.224
Just... it was, just a bad joke.

523
00:43:50.577 --> 00:43:52.851
- You were kidding, right?
- I have no idea.

524
00:43:52.928 --> 00:43:57.071
We're talking about time travel here.
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

525
00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:00.244
We're good! Get your helmet on.

526
00:44:00.956 --> 00:44:03.684
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week, but you'll walk

527
00:44:03.709 --> 00:44:06.710
around for an hour, then bring
you back in 10 seconds.

528
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.337
- Makes sense?
- Perfectly not confusing.

529
00:44:09.362 --> 00:44:11.965
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

530
00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:16.720
You're right. I do,
Captain America.

531
00:44:18.377 --> 00:44:24.224
On the count of three.
3.. 2.. 1..

532
00:44:27.982 --> 00:44:31.265
Guys? This doesn't feel right.

533
00:44:31.405 --> 00:44:33.274
- What's going on? Hold on.
- Who is that?

534
00:44:33.299 --> 00:44:35.308
- Is that Scott?
- Yes, it's Scott!

535
00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:40.096
Ooh! My back!

536
00:44:42.664 --> 00:44:45.107
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it!

537
00:44:52.049 --> 00:44:53.049
A baby.

538
00:44:53.075 --> 00:44:54.661
- It's Scott.
- As a baby!

539
00:44:55.331 --> 00:44:56.388
Bring Scott back.

540
00:44:56.413 --> 00:44:58.709
When I say kill the
power, kill the power.

541
00:44:59.921 --> 00:45:01.992
And... kill it!

542
00:45:05.444 --> 00:45:07.835
Somebody peed my pants.

543
00:45:09.094 --> 00:45:12.103
I don't know if it was
"baby" me or "old" me.

544
00:45:15.467 --> 00:45:17.477
Or, just "me" me.

545
00:45:17.532 --> 00:45:19.361
Time travel!

546
00:45:22.887 --> 00:45:23.888
What?

547
00:45:25.232 --> 00:45:28.030
I see this as an absolute win.

548
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.464
Why the long face?

549
00:46:14.527 --> 00:46:16.457
Let me guess. He
turned into a baby.

550
00:46:17.484 --> 00:46:19.672
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

551
00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:21.697
That's the EPR paradox.

552
00:46:21.893 --> 00:46:25.544
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you
might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

553
00:46:25.569 --> 00:46:28.522
It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody
coulda cautioned you against it.

554
00:46:28.532 --> 00:46:30.955
- You did.
- Oh, did I?

555
00:46:31.678 --> 00:46:36.259
Thank God, I'm here.
Regardless, I fixed it.

556
00:46:36.284 --> 00:46:38.706
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

557
00:46:40.728 --> 00:46:42.796
I just want peace.

558
00:46:43.339 --> 00:46:46.630
Turns out, resentment is
corrosive, and I hate it.

559
00:46:47.145 --> 00:46:48.466
Me, too.

560
00:46:49.731 --> 00:46:51.566
We got a shot at getting
these stones, but I

561
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:53.343
gotta tell you my
priority is to bring back

562
00:46:53.373 --> 00:46:55.763
what we lost? I hope, yes.

563
00:46:55.788 --> 00:46:58.657
Keep what I found? I
have to, at all costs.

564
00:46:59.885 --> 00:47:03.731
And, maybe not die
trying will be nice.

565
00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:08.023
Sounds like a deal.

566
00:47:31.086 --> 00:47:35.135
- Tony, I don't know...
- Why? He made it for you.

567
00:47:35.784 --> 00:47:40.193
Plus, honestly I have to get it out the
garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

568
00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:46.304
Thank you, Tony.

569
00:47:47.047 --> 00:47:51.197
Will you keep that a little quietly?
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

570
00:47:52.321 --> 00:47:57.801
- We are getting, the whole team, yeah?
- We're working on that right now.

571
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:21.423
- Hey, humie! Where's big green?
- Kitchen. I think.

572
00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:26.989
- That's awesome.
- Rodent, careful on re-entry.

573
00:48:27.005 --> 00:48:29.608
There's an idiot on
the landing zone.

574
00:48:30.129 --> 00:48:31.130
Oh, God!

575
00:48:32.029 --> 00:48:34.514
What's up, regular-sized man?

576
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:29.330
Kind of a step down from a golden palace
for an Avenger highness or whatnot.

577
00:49:29.355 --> 00:49:31.848
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.
First, they've lost Asgard,

578
00:49:31.873 --> 00:49:34.765
then half the people. They're probably
just happy they have a home.

579
00:49:34.791 --> 00:49:36.909
You shouldn't have come!

580
00:49:38.402 --> 00:49:39.403
Valkyrie!

581
00:49:39.945 --> 00:49:42.282
Great to see you, Angry Girl.

582
00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:45.713
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

583
00:49:46.158 --> 00:49:48.339
- This is Rocket.
- How you doin'?

584
00:49:50.403 --> 00:49:52.529
- He won't see you.
- That bad, huh?

585
00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:55.220
We only see him once a month,
when he comes in for...

586
00:49:56.471 --> 00:49:57.862
...supplies.

587
00:49:58.416 --> 00:50:00.418
- It's that bad.
- Yeah.

588
00:50:13.123 --> 00:50:14.249
What the...

589
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.864
Woo! Something died in here.

590
00:50:20.505 --> 00:50:22.725
Hello? Thor?

591
00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:25.327
Are you here about the cable?

592
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:31.160
The Cinemax ran out two weeks ago,
and, sports were all kind of fuzzy...

593
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.662
Boys! Oh, my God!

594
00:50:45.203 --> 00:50:47.501
My God! How have you been?

595
00:50:47.704 --> 00:50:49.706
Come here, you little rascal!

596
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:51.730
No, I'm good! I'm good.

597
00:50:52.105 --> 00:50:53.864
That's not necessary!

598
00:50:53.908 --> 00:50:56.722
Hulk, you know my friends,
Miek, Korg, right?

599
00:50:56.754 --> 00:50:59.119
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys. Long time no see.

600
00:50:59.144 --> 00:51:02.015
Beer's on the bucket. Feel
free to log on to the wi-fi.

601
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.750
No password, obviously.

602
00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:08.758
Thor, he's back. That kid on the TV
who's called me a dickhead again.

603
00:51:09.595 --> 00:51:12.824
- Noobmaster.
- Yeah, Noobmaster69.

604
00:51:15.459 --> 00:51:18.461
Noobmaster. Hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder?

605
00:51:18.492 --> 00:51:21.533
Listen, buddy. If you don't log off
this game immediately I'm gonna fly

606
00:51:21.558 --> 00:51:24.379
home to your house, come down to
that basement you're hiding in,

607
00:51:24.404 --> 00:51:26.841
rip off your arms then
shove them up your butt!

608
00:51:27.258 --> 00:51:30.354
Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to
your father, you little weasel!

609
00:51:30.658 --> 00:51:31.808
Thank you, Thor.

610
00:51:31.833 --> 00:51:33.420
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

611
00:51:33.445 --> 00:51:34.942
Thank you very much. I will.

612
00:51:35.496 --> 00:51:37.169
So you guys want a drink?
What are you drinking?

613
00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.664
We have beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

614
00:51:42.705 --> 00:51:45.262
Buddy, you all right?

615
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:48.122
Yes, I'm fine! Why,
don't I look all right?

616
00:51:48.248 --> 00:51:50.296
You look like melted ice cream.

617
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.167
So, what's up?

618
00:51:54.199 --> 00:51:58.646
We need your help. There might be
a chance we could fix everything.

619
00:51:58.702 --> 00:52:02.453
What, like the cable? 'Cause that's
been driving me bananas for weeks.

620
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:03.892
Like Thanos.

621
00:52:22.615 --> 00:52:25.673
Don't say that name.

622
00:52:26.218 --> 00:52:29.283
Um, yeah. We don't actually
say that name in here.

623
00:52:34.103 --> 00:52:36.128
Please take your hand off me.

624
00:52:39.075 --> 00:52:40.076
Now, I know that...

625
00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:44.436
guy might scare you.

626
00:52:44.695 --> 00:52:48.979
Why would I be? Why would, why
would I be scared of that guy?

627
00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:51.896
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

628
00:52:52.638 --> 00:52:55.077
Anyone else here
killed that guy?

629
00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.115
Nope. Didn't think so.

630
00:53:01.726 --> 00:53:05.853
Korg, why don't you, tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off.

631
00:53:05.878 --> 00:53:07.644
Umm... Stormbreaker?

632
00:53:07.669 --> 00:53:10.192
Now, who's swinging
Stormbreaker?

633
00:53:13.366 --> 00:53:16.941
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?
I've been there myself.

634
00:53:16.949 --> 00:53:19.192
You wanna know who
helped me out of it?

635
00:53:19.216 --> 00:53:22.170
I don't know. Is it... Natasha?

636
00:53:22.194 --> 00:53:23.359
It was you.

637
00:53:24.274 --> 00:53:25.923
You helped me.

638
00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:32.247
Why don't you ask the,
Asgardians down there,

639
00:53:32.271 --> 00:53:34.804
how much my help was worth.

640
00:53:39.687 --> 00:53:41.653
The ones that are left, anyway.

641
00:53:41.902 --> 00:53:43.686
I think we can bring them back.

642
00:53:44.178 --> 00:53:47.406
Stop. Just, stop...

643
00:53:48.332 --> 00:53:53.358
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in
my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and

644
00:53:53.383 --> 00:53:56.199
and saved. But I'm fine, okay?
We're fine, aren't we?

645
00:53:56.224 --> 00:53:57.473
Nah, all good here, mate!

646
00:53:57.498 --> 00:53:59.357
So, whatever it is that
you're offering, we're

647
00:53:59.382 --> 00:54:01.734
not into it, don't care,
couldn't care less.

648
00:54:01.766 --> 00:54:02.890
Goodbye.

649
00:54:06.275 --> 00:54:07.550
We need you, pal.

650
00:54:17.338 --> 00:54:19.324
There's beer on the ship.

651
00:54:23.555 --> 00:54:24.689
What kind?

652
00:54:37.372 --> 00:54:39.724
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

653
00:55:10.597 --> 00:55:12.379
We never did anything to you!

654
00:55:24.815 --> 00:55:27.264
You're done hurting people.

655
00:55:33.412 --> 00:55:34.592
You're crazy!

656
00:56:01.834 --> 00:56:05.593
Wait! Help me!

657
00:56:11.277 --> 00:56:12.747
What I want...

658
00:56:13.469 --> 00:56:14.914
You can't give me.

659
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:40.121
You shouldn't be here.

660
00:56:42.123 --> 00:56:43.679
Neither should you.

661
00:56:49.731 --> 00:56:51.380
I've got a job to do.

662
00:56:52.982 --> 00:56:55.061
Is that what you're
calling this?

663
00:56:55.672 --> 00:56:58.876
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

664
00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:05.588
We found something.

665
00:57:06.816 --> 00:57:08.919
A chance, maybe...

666
00:57:12.329 --> 00:57:13.415
Don't.

667
00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:15.948
Don't what?

668
00:57:18.653 --> 00:57:20.451
Don't give me hope.

669
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:26.436
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

670
00:57:47.892 --> 00:57:51.519
Drifting left. On the
side there, Lebowski.

671
00:57:54.647 --> 00:57:56.838
- Ratchet, how's it going?
- It's Rocket.

672
00:57:56.863 --> 00:57:59.958
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

673
00:58:00.013 --> 00:58:01.013
Yup.

674
00:58:04.517 --> 00:58:07.033
Time travel suit? Not bad.

675
00:58:07.462 --> 00:58:09.104
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!

676
00:58:09.135 --> 00:58:11.894
- I'm being very careful.
- No, you're being very Hulky.

677
00:58:11.903 --> 00:58:14.479
- I'm being careful.
- These are Pym particles, all right?

678
00:58:14.504 --> 00:58:17.257
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

679
00:58:17.282 --> 00:58:19.337
This is what we have. We're
not making any more.

680
00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:21.108
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

681
00:58:21.147 --> 00:58:23.513
We've got enough for
one round trip, each.

682
00:58:23.538 --> 00:58:27.494
That's it. No do-overs.
Plus, two test runs.

683
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:33.332
One test run.

684
00:58:34.129 --> 00:58:35.928
All right. I'm not
ready for this.

685
00:58:35.953 --> 00:58:37.037
I'm game.

686
00:58:39.594 --> 00:58:40.681
I'll do it.

687
00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.003
Clint, now you're gonna feel
a little discombobulated

688
00:58:44.028 --> 00:58:45.762
from the chronoshift.
Don't worry about it.

689
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:47.097
Wait a second, let me
ask you something.

690
00:58:47.122 --> 00:58:49.944
If we can do this, you know, go
back in time, why don't we just

691
00:58:49.969 --> 00:58:53.157
find baby Thanos, you know?
And...

692
00:58:56.465 --> 00:58:58.708
- First of all, that's horrible.
- It's Thanos.

693
00:58:58.733 --> 00:59:03.275
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

694
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.169
Look, we go back, we get the
stones before Thanos gets them...

695
00:59:06.194 --> 00:59:09.094
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

696
00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:10.977
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

697
00:59:11.002 --> 00:59:13.416
- Well, that's what I heard.
- What? By who? Who told you that?

698
00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:16.263
Star Trek, Terminator,
TimeCop, Time After Time,

699
00:59:16.288 --> 00:59:17.613
- Quantum Leap.
- A Wrinkle in Time,

700
00:59:17.638 --> 00:59:20.138
- Somewhere in Time,
- Hot Tub Time Machine.

701
00:59:20.163 --> 00:59:24.423
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically,
any movie that deals with time travel.

702
00:59:24.448 --> 00:59:26.293
Die Hard? No, it's not...

703
00:59:26.317 --> 00:59:27.357
This is known.

704
00:59:27.382 --> 00:59:29.726
I don't know why everyone believes
that, but that isn't true.

705
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:34.071
Think about it: If you travel to the
past, that past becomes your future.

706
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:37.444
And your former present
becomes the past.

707
00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:40.352
Which can't now be changed
by your new future...

708
00:59:40.396 --> 00:59:41.477
Exactly.

709
00:59:41.797 --> 00:59:44.454
So Back to the Future's
a bunch of bullshit?

710
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:55.377
All right, Clint. We're going in 3..
2.. 1...

711
01:01:07.843 --> 01:01:08.992
Cooper?

712
01:01:09.196 --> 01:01:12.034
- Where are my headphones?
- Lila?

713
01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.952
Lila! No!

714
01:01:24.191 --> 01:01:25.192
Dad?

715
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.179
Dad?

716
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:43.215
Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?

717
01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:45.068
Yeah.

718
01:01:47.967 --> 01:01:49.266
It worked.

719
01:01:50.919 --> 01:01:52.084
It worked.

720
01:01:55.469 --> 01:01:57.391
Okay, so the "how" works.

721
01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.192
Now we gotta figure out the
"when," and the "where."

722
01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:03.853
Almost everyone in this
room has had an encounter

723
01:02:03.878 --> 01:02:05.706
with at least one of the
six Infinity Stones.

724
01:02:05.746 --> 01:02:07.511
Well, I'd subtitute the
word 'encounter' for 'damn

725
01:02:07.536 --> 01:02:09.998
near been killed by one of
the six Infinity Stones.'

726
01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:13.617
I haven't. I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.

727
01:02:13.742 --> 01:02:18.737
Regardless, we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round trip each,

728
01:02:18.784 --> 01:02:22.146
and these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

729
01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:26.343
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

730
01:02:26.532 --> 01:02:30.096
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

731
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:33.363
So. Let's start
with the Aether.

732
01:02:33.527 --> 01:02:35.465
Thor, what do you know?

733
01:02:40.446 --> 01:02:41.665
Is he asleep?

734
01:02:47.185 --> 01:02:49.522
Where to start? Umm...

735
01:02:50.665 --> 01:02:53.502
The Aether, first,
is not a stone.

736
01:02:53.682 --> 01:02:57.075
Someone's called it a stone before.
Ahem...

737
01:02:57.137 --> 01:03:00.842
It's more of a... an angry
sludge, sort of thing. So...

738
01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:04.010
Someone's gonna need to amend
that, and stop saying that.

739
01:03:04.217 --> 01:03:06.151
Here's an interesting
story, though.

740
01:03:06.232 --> 01:03:08.682
About the Aether. My
grandafther, many years

741
01:03:08.707 --> 01:03:12.712
ago, had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

742
01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.522
Scary beings. So Jane...

743
01:03:17.867 --> 01:03:23.667
Oh, there she is. That's Jane...
She's... an old flame of mine.

744
01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:27.675
She... she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

745
01:03:27.711 --> 01:03:31.037
and then the Aether stuck
itself inside her.

746
01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:34.263
And, she became very, very sick.
So I had to take her to

747
01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:38.024
Asgard, which is where I'm from.
And we had to try and fix her.

748
01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:43.700
We were dating at the time, you see. I
got to introduce her to my Mother...

749
01:03:45.117 --> 01:03:47.353
who's dead, and umm....

750
01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:52.166
Oh, you know. Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...

751
01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:55.042
These things happen though, you know.
Nothing lasts forever.

752
01:03:55.067 --> 01:03:56.299
- The only thing that...
- Why don't you come sit down.

753
01:03:56.324 --> 01:04:00.726
I'm not done yet. The only thing that
is permanent in life, is impermanence.

754
01:04:01.485 --> 01:04:02.594
Awesome.

755
01:04:02.619 --> 01:04:03.790
Eggs? Breakfast?

756
01:04:03.815 --> 01:04:05.755
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

757
01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:08.669
Quill said he stole the
Power Stone from Morag.

758
01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:12.226
- Is that a person?
- Morag's a planet.

759
01:04:12.505 --> 01:04:14.201
Quill was a person.

760
01:04:14.803 --> 01:04:17.374
Like a planet? Like
in outer space?

761
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.307
Oh, look. It's like a little
puppy, all happy and everything.

762
01:04:21.439 --> 01:04:24.965
Do you wanna go to space? You
wanna go to space, puppy?

763
01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.214
I'll take you to space.

764
01:04:27.504 --> 01:04:31.139
- Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
- What is Vormir?

765
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:36.205
A dominion of death, at the very
center of Celestial existence.

766
01:04:37.599 --> 01:04:41.391
It's where... Thanos
murdered my sister.

767
01:04:47.807 --> 01:04:48.807
Noted.

768
01:04:50.668 --> 01:04:52.770
- That Time Stone guy...
- Doctor Strange.

769
01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:54.357
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

770
01:04:54.365 --> 01:04:58.024
- Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat.
- Nice place in the village, though.

771
01:04:58.056 --> 01:05:00.508
- Yeah. Sullivan Street.
- Hmm... Bleecker.

772
01:05:00.533 --> 01:05:02.143
Wait, he lived in New York?

773
01:05:02.409 --> 01:05:05.387
- No. He lived in Toronto.
- Yeah, not Bleecker. It's Sullivan.

774
01:05:05.759 --> 01:05:10.644
Guys, if you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

775
01:05:12.928 --> 01:05:14.366
Shut the front door!

776
01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:19.853
All right. We have a plan.

777
01:05:19.931 --> 01:05:24.566
Six stones, three
teams, one shot.

778
01:05:33.899 --> 01:05:36.002
Five years ago, we lost.

779
01:05:37.011 --> 01:05:38.190
All of us.

780
01:05:40.279 --> 01:05:41.327
We lost friends...

781
01:05:42.724 --> 01:05:43.819
We lost family...

782
01:05:46.201 --> 01:05:48.014
We lost a part of ourselves.

783
01:05:49.242 --> 01:05:51.704
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

784
01:05:52.922 --> 01:05:56.103
You know your teams, you
know your missions.

785
01:05:56.518 --> 01:05:59.348
Get the stones, get them back.

786
01:05:59.403 --> 01:06:03.765
One round trip each. No mistakes.
No do-overs.

787
01:06:04.188 --> 01:06:06.405
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

788
01:06:06.459 --> 01:06:09.148
But it doesn't mean we
should know what to expect.

789
01:06:09.367 --> 01:06:12.572
Be careful. Look out
for each other.

790
01:06:13.652 --> 01:06:17.803
This is the fight of our lives.
And we're gonna win.

791
01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.532
Whatever it takes.

792
01:06:24.229 --> 01:06:25.527
Good luck.

793
01:06:26.206 --> 01:06:27.998
- He's pretty good at that.
- Right?

794
01:06:28.076 --> 01:06:31.015
All right. You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, jelly green.

795
01:06:31.725 --> 01:06:33.836
Tractors engaged.

796
01:06:34.213 --> 01:06:36.251
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

797
01:06:36.276 --> 01:06:38.269
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay.

798
01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:42.054
- I'll do my best.
- As promises go, that was pretty lame.

799
01:06:44.613 --> 01:06:46.096
See you in a minute.

800
01:07:40.249 --> 01:07:43.665
All right, we all have our assignments.
Two stones uptown, one stone, down.

801
01:07:44.087 --> 01:07:46.471
Stay low. Keep an
eye on the clock.

802
01:08:01.313 --> 01:08:03.649
Feel free to smash if
things don't go your way.

803
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.620
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

804
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:37.526
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

805
01:08:42.044 --> 01:08:44.686
Ma'am, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

806
01:08:45.976 --> 01:08:48.900
You're about... five
years too early.

807
01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:53.629
Stephen Strange is currently performing
surgery about twenty blocks that way.

808
01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:56.701
What do you want from him?

809
01:08:57.072 --> 01:08:58.604
That, actually.

810
01:08:58.893 --> 01:08:59.894
Ah.

811
01:09:01.232 --> 01:09:04.405
- I'm afraid not.
- Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

812
01:09:04.929 --> 01:09:06.859
- You don't wanna do this.
- You're right. I don't.

813
01:09:06.884 --> 01:09:10.120
But I need that stone, and
I don't have time to...

814
01:09:18.147 --> 01:09:20.125
Let's start over, shall we?

815
01:09:39.437 --> 01:09:40.594
That's Jane.

816
01:09:42.236 --> 01:09:43.315
All right.

817
01:09:44.916 --> 01:09:46.495
Here's the deal, Tubby:

818
01:09:46.504 --> 01:09:48.595
You're gonna charm her and I'm
gonna poke her with this thing

819
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.851
and extract the Reality Stone
and get gone, lickety-split.

820
01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:56.206
I'll be right back, okay? There's a
wine cellar, that's just down there.

821
01:09:56.231 --> 01:09:59.028
My father used to fish
with a barrel of ale.

822
01:09:59.084 --> 01:10:03.289
- I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...
- Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

823
01:10:22.105 --> 01:10:23.996
Who's the fancy broad?

824
01:10:24.858 --> 01:10:28.524
It's my Mother.
She dies today.

825
01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:31.478
Oh. That's today?

826
01:10:37.618 --> 01:10:40.682
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

827
01:10:40.707 --> 01:10:44.044
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.
This was a bad idea.

828
01:10:44.154 --> 01:10:46.389
- Come here.
- No, no, no. I think I'm having...

829
01:10:46.428 --> 01:10:49.875
- I'm having a panic attack.
- Come here. Right here.

830
01:10:50.408 --> 01:10:54.292
You think you're the only one who lost
people? What do you think we're doing here?

831
01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:56.489
I lost the only
family I ever had.

832
01:10:56.514 --> 01:11:00.696
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick
with the antenna, all gone.

833
01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:05.746
Now, I get you miss your Mom.
But she's gone. Really gone.

834
01:11:06.059 --> 01:11:08.889
And there are plenty of people
who are only kinda gone.

835
01:11:08.928 --> 01:11:10.742
But you can help them.

836
01:11:11.171 --> 01:11:14.552
So is it too much to ask that you
brush the crumbs outta your beard,

837
01:11:14.577 --> 01:11:18.533
make schmoopy talk to Pretty
Pants, and when she's not looking,

838
01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.668
suck out the Infinity Stone and
help me get my family back?

839
01:11:23.604 --> 01:11:24.605
Okay.

840
01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:27.794
- Are you crying?
- No...

841
01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:30.941
Yes!

842
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:33.630
Get it together!
You can do this.

843
01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:35.881
You can do this.

844
01:11:38.954 --> 01:11:40.134
All right?

845
01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.652
- Yes, I can.
- Good.

846
01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:46.880
I can do this.

847
01:11:47.881 --> 01:11:49.124
I can't do this.

848
01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:52.891
Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone.
This is our shot.

849
01:11:52.947 --> 01:11:53.947
Thor?

850
01:11:54.581 --> 01:11:55.581
Thor!

851
01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:07.547
Alright. Bring it down low.

852
01:12:07.572 --> 01:12:10.117
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

853
01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:15.967
Hey, can we hurry it up?

854
01:12:15.992 --> 01:12:18.199
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

855
01:12:18.344 --> 01:12:21.208
All that, is really helpful.

856
01:12:22.473 --> 01:12:24.168
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

857
01:12:24.288 --> 01:12:26.788
Take that stone and come back.
No messing around.

858
01:12:27.037 --> 01:12:28.850
- Hey.
- You got this.

859
01:12:28.948 --> 01:12:30.197
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

860
01:12:30.257 --> 01:12:31.870
See you back.

861
01:12:32.386 --> 01:12:34.310
You guys watch each other's six.

862
01:12:34.318 --> 01:12:35.319
Yeah.

863
01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:46.654
The coordinates for
Vormir are laid in.

864
01:12:47.442 --> 01:12:49.951
All they have to do
is not fall out.

865
01:12:55.358 --> 01:12:57.992
We're a long way from Budapest.

866
01:13:02.282 --> 01:13:03.665
Okay, so, uhh...

867
01:13:05.352 --> 01:13:08.298
We just wait around for this
Quill guy to show up and

868
01:13:08.323 --> 01:13:10.997
then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

869
01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:13.084
Let's take cover.

870
01:13:14.038 --> 01:13:17.071
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

871
01:13:17.196 --> 01:13:18.611
Wait a minute, what are
you talking about right

872
01:13:18.636 --> 01:13:20.580
now? Who else is looking
for these stones?

873
01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:26.183
My father, my sister...

874
01:13:27.163 --> 01:13:29.649
- and me.
- And you?

875
01:13:31.328 --> 01:13:33.289
Where are you right now?

876
01:14:01.869 --> 01:14:05.137
- You're welcome.
- I didn't ask for your help.

877
01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:08.474
And yet, you always need it.

878
01:14:11.579 --> 01:14:12.697
Get up.

879
01:14:12.783 --> 01:14:15.143
- Father wants us back on the ship.
- Why?

880
01:14:15.198 --> 01:14:17.684
He's found an Infinity Stone.

881
01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:25.127
- Where?
- On a planet called Morag.

882
01:14:26.491 --> 01:14:28.782
Father's plan is
finally in motion.

883
01:14:28.807 --> 01:14:32.168
- One stone isn't six, Nebula.
- It's a start.

884
01:14:32.329 --> 01:14:34.838
If he gets all of them...

885
01:14:46.787 --> 01:14:50.508
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

886
01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:53.893
- He won't like that.
- His alternative is death, then.

887
01:14:55.599 --> 01:15:00.493
Ronan's obsession
clouds his judgement.

888
01:15:04.769 --> 01:15:06.841
We will not fail you, Father.

889
01:15:07.944 --> 01:15:09.773
No, you won't.

890
01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:13.636
I swear...

891
01:15:15.131 --> 01:15:17.311
I will make you proud.

892
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:28.617
We just, wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,

893
01:15:28.642 --> 01:15:31.238
and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

894
01:15:31.622 --> 01:15:33.099
Let's take cover.

895
01:15:33.998 --> 01:15:37.539
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

896
01:15:39.416 --> 01:15:41.612
- Who was that?
- I don't know...

897
01:15:41.674 --> 01:15:44.754
My head is splitting...
I don't know...

898
01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:49.277
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

899
01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:00.912
Bring her to my ship.

900
01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.454
Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.

901
01:16:11.479 --> 01:16:14.066
Got it. I'm approaching
the elevator now.

902
01:16:19.989 --> 01:16:21.990
If it's all the same to you...

903
01:16:24.131 --> 01:16:25.800
I'll have that drink now.

904
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:30.495
All right. Good one. No standing around,
I'm closing up this door for later.

905
01:16:30.534 --> 01:16:32.480
By the way, feel
free to clean up.

906
01:16:32.527 --> 01:16:35.138
Ugh, Mr. Rogers. I almost
forgot that that suit

907
01:16:35.184 --> 01:16:38.624
- did nothing for your ass.
- No one asked you to look.

908
01:16:38.683 --> 01:16:40.692
I think you look great, Cap.

909
01:16:40.717 --> 01:16:44.410
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

910
01:16:44.523 --> 01:16:47.631
- Uhh, magic wand?
- STRIKE team's coming to secure it.

911
01:16:57.781 --> 01:16:59.695
We can take that
off your hands.

912
01:16:59.797 --> 01:17:01.024
By all means.

913
01:17:02.847 --> 01:17:06.443
- Careful with that thing!
- Unless you want your mind erased.

914
01:17:06.468 --> 01:17:08.640
- Not in a fun way.
- We promise to be careful.

915
01:17:08.675 --> 01:17:11.497
- Who are these guys?
- They are SHIELD...

916
01:17:11.536 --> 01:17:14.397
Well, actually Hydra. But,
we didn't know that yet.

917
01:17:14.447 --> 01:17:18.434
Seriously, you didn't? I mean...
they look like bad guys.

918
01:17:18.481 --> 01:17:20.335
You're small, but
you're talking loud.

919
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.974
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.

920
01:17:21.999 --> 01:17:24.127
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue!

921
01:17:24.152 --> 01:17:26.923
I mean, honestly! How do
you think you'll be...

922
01:17:26.948 --> 01:17:28.169
Shut up.

923
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.508
All right, you're up, little buddy.
There's our stone.

924
01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.174
Alright. Flick me.

925
01:17:50.321 --> 01:17:51.920
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
- Hey! Buddy.

926
01:17:51.955 --> 01:17:54.354
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

927
01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:57.216
- Take the stairs!
- Yeah. Stop. Stop!

928
01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:03.122
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs!

929
01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:11.228
All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the
elevator just passing the 80th floor.

930
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:12.847
On it.

931
01:18:13.534 --> 01:18:16.020
- Head to the lobby.
- Alright. I'll see you there.

932
01:18:16.045 --> 01:18:19.022
Evidence secure. We're
en route to Dr. List.

933
01:18:19.586 --> 01:18:22.955
No. No hitches at all, Mr.
Secretary.

934
01:18:28.122 --> 01:18:31.101
Captain. I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue?

935
01:18:31.187 --> 01:18:32.836
Change of plans.

936
01:18:36.353 --> 01:18:37.440
Hey, Cap.

937
01:18:38.789 --> 01:18:40.028
Rumlow.

938
01:18:46.568 --> 01:18:50.601
I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm
gonna be running point on the scepter.

939
01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:55.525
Sir? I don't understand.

940
01:18:57.473 --> 01:18:59.591
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

941
01:18:59.616 --> 01:19:00.866
Sorry, Cap.

942
01:19:01.295 --> 01:19:03.185
I can't give you the scepter.

943
01:19:03.319 --> 01:19:07.657
- I'm gonna have to call the Director.
- That's okay. Trust me.

944
01:19:11.174 --> 01:19:12.721
Hail Hydra.

945
01:19:26.712 --> 01:19:28.808
So many stairs!

946
01:19:40.313 --> 01:19:43.096
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

947
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.614
- It is go-time.
- Bombs away.

948
01:19:52.945 --> 01:19:55.063
Is, is that Axe body spray?

949
01:19:55.088 --> 01:19:57.863
Yeah, I had a can just
for emergencies. Relax.

950
01:19:57.933 --> 01:20:02.006
- Can we focus, please?
- I'm going inside you. Now.

951
01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:09.106
May I ask you
where you're going?

952
01:20:09.131 --> 01:20:11.637
To lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?

953
01:20:11.662 --> 01:20:15.298
Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one
of the folks behind Nick Fury.

954
01:20:15.323 --> 01:20:16.790
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

955
01:20:16.824 --> 01:20:19.293
I'm gonna have to ask you to
turn that prisoner over to me.

956
01:20:19.364 --> 01:20:22.420
- Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
- Oh, he's gonna answer to us.

957
01:20:22.446 --> 01:20:25.172
Odin can have what's left. And
I'm gonna need that case.

958
01:20:25.329 --> 01:20:27.331
That's been SHIELD property
for over 70 years.

959
01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:28.574
Hand over the case, Stark.

960
01:20:28.599 --> 01:20:31.241
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things
are getting dicey up here. Let's go.

961
01:20:31.266 --> 01:20:33.435
I'm not gonna argue who's got the
higher authority here, all right?

962
01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.852
You promise me you won't die?

963
01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:37.860
You're only giving me a
mild cardiac dysrythmia.

964
01:20:37.915 --> 01:20:39.619
That doesn't sound mild.

965
01:20:39.644 --> 01:20:40.263
I need the case.

966
01:20:40.288 --> 01:20:42.123
I know you got a lotta pull.
I'm just saying...

967
01:20:42.148 --> 01:20:43.938
Okay. Then give me the case.

968
01:20:45.861 --> 01:20:46.862
Do it, Lang!

969
01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:49.614
- Get your hands off!
- Window's closing. Pull my pin!

970
01:20:49.777 --> 01:20:50.896
Here goes!

971
01:20:54.156 --> 01:20:56.032
- Stark?
- Stark!

972
01:20:56.071 --> 01:20:58.079
Look, he's convulsing.
Give him air!

973
01:20:58.104 --> 01:21:00.113
- Medic!
- Medic!

974
01:21:00.371 --> 01:21:02.356
You got some help!

975
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.187
Stark, you--- your
chest machine?

976
01:21:07.969 --> 01:21:09.220
Breathe! Breathe!

977
01:21:14.507 --> 01:21:17.454
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

978
01:21:22.895 --> 01:21:24.990
No stairs!

979
01:21:32.547 --> 01:21:34.057
You'll be fine, Stark.
Stay with us!

980
01:21:34.088 --> 01:21:37.121
I'll try something, okay? I have
no idea if it's gonna work.

981
01:21:38.684 --> 01:21:39.357
Yes!

982
01:21:39.382 --> 01:21:41.640
That worked a treat.
That was so crazy!

983
01:21:41.656 --> 01:21:43.673
I had no idea if
that was gonna work.

984
01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.540
- The case...
- The case. It's, uhh...

985
01:21:45.581 --> 01:21:48.051
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

986
01:21:48.324 --> 01:21:49.324
Loki!

987
01:21:49.357 --> 01:21:52.468
- That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
- Oh, we blew it.

988
01:21:52.515 --> 01:21:53.922
Loki!?

989
01:21:56.001 --> 01:21:57.697
Tony, what's going on?

990
01:21:58.182 --> 01:22:00.332
Tell me you found that cube.

991
01:22:02.232 --> 01:22:04.295
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

992
01:22:08.142 --> 01:22:10.543
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

993
01:22:10.653 --> 01:22:11.966
I'm not Loki.

994
01:22:15.337 --> 01:22:17.322
And I don't wanna hurt you.

995
01:22:26.156 --> 01:22:27.438
I can do this all day.

996
01:22:27.463 --> 01:22:29.847
Yeah, I know. I know.

997
01:23:02.373 --> 01:23:04.233
Where did you get this?

998
01:23:14.768 --> 01:23:18.336
Bucky... is... alive!

999
01:23:21.181 --> 01:23:22.181
What?

1000
01:23:37.187 --> 01:23:39.282
That is America's ass.

1001
01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:46.216
- Please, please!
- I'm sorry. I can't help you, Bruce.

1002
01:23:47.116 --> 01:23:50.743
If I give up the Time Stone to help
your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1003
01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:55.645
With all due respect, I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

1004
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:05.412
The Infinity Stones create what you
experience as the flow of time.

1005
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:09.373
Remove one of the stones,
and that flow splits.

1006
01:24:09.631 --> 01:24:14.697
Now this may benefit your reality.
But my new one, not so much.

1007
01:24:14.737 --> 01:24:19.982
In this new branched reality, without our
chief weapon against the forces of darkness,

1008
01:24:20.205 --> 01:24:24.083
our world will be overrun.
Millions will suffer.

1009
01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.296
So, tell me, doctor, can your
science prevent all that?

1010
01:24:28.398 --> 01:24:31.696
No. But we can erase it.

1011
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.628
Because once we're done with the stones, we
can return each one into its own timeline

1012
01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:40.014
at the moment it was taken.
So, chronologically...

1013
01:24:41.031 --> 01:24:46.214
In that reality....
it never left.

1014
01:24:48.601 --> 01:24:51.767
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1015
01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:58.051
In order to return the
stones, you have to survive.

1016
01:24:58.098 --> 01:25:00.913
We will. I will. I promise.

1017
01:25:01.571 --> 01:25:04.324
I can't risk this
reality on a promise.

1018
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:09.444
It's the duty, of the Sorcerer
Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

1019
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.040
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1020
01:25:13.838 --> 01:25:16.057
- What did you say?
- Strange. He gave it away.

1021
01:25:16.096 --> 01:25:17.880
He gave it to Thanos.

1022
01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.052
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1023
01:25:23.808 --> 01:25:26.982
- Why?
- I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.

1024
01:25:37.442 --> 01:25:38.724
Or I did.

1025
01:25:58.864 --> 01:26:01.553
Strange was meant to
be the best of us.

1026
01:26:01.577 --> 01:26:04.446
So he must've done
it for a reason.

1027
01:26:04.843 --> 01:26:07.188
I fear you might be right.

1028
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.535
Thank you.

1029
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:20.625
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1030
01:26:22.564 --> 01:26:23.923
We all are.

1031
01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:45.647
Run diagnostics.

1032
01:26:46.476 --> 01:26:48.313
Show me her memory file.

1033
01:26:50.048 --> 01:26:52.573
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1034
01:26:53.723 --> 01:26:56.005
It was a memory, but not hers.

1035
01:26:56.826 --> 01:26:59.937
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.

1036
01:27:00.273 --> 01:27:01.688
Another Nebula.

1037
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:05.120
Impossible.

1038
01:27:05.574 --> 01:27:10.983
This duplicate carries a time stamp...
from nine years in the future.

1039
01:27:15.755 --> 01:27:17.811
Where is this other Nebula?

1040
01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:21.477
In our solar system.
On Morag.

1041
01:27:22.393 --> 01:27:25.934
- Can you access her?
- Yes. The two are linked.

1042
01:27:25.965 --> 01:27:30.382
Search the duplicate's
memories, for Infinity Stones.

1043
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:37.181
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

1044
01:27:37.197 --> 01:27:41.206
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

1045
01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:44.044
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

1046
01:27:44.069 --> 01:27:45.405
Freeze image.

1047
01:27:47.094 --> 01:27:48.423
Terrans.

1048
01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:50.886
Avengers.

1049
01:27:51.973 --> 01:27:56.139
Unruly wretches. What's
that reflection?

1050
01:27:56.968 --> 01:27:59.525
Amplify this, Maw.

1051
01:28:01.518 --> 01:28:03.175
I don't understand.

1052
01:28:07.584 --> 01:28:12.071
- Two Nebulas.
- No. The same Nebula.

1053
01:28:12.515 --> 01:28:14.399
From two different times.

1054
01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:19.558
Set course for Morag. Scan
the duplicate's memories.

1055
01:28:20.458 --> 01:28:22.998
I want to see everything.

1056
01:28:32.718 --> 01:28:34.705
My ladies, I'll see you after.
Go on.

1057
01:28:50.556 --> 01:28:53.072
- What are you doing?
- Ahh!

1058
01:28:54.487 --> 01:28:57.130
You're better off leaving the
sneaking to your brother.

1059
01:28:57.162 --> 01:28:59.397
Yeah, I was simply just
going for a walk, and uh...

1060
01:28:59.422 --> 01:29:00.821
What are you wearing?

1061
01:29:00.846 --> 01:29:03.189
I always wear this. This
is one of my favorites.

1062
01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:08.720
What's wrong with your eye?

1063
01:29:08.745 --> 01:29:11.895
Oh, my eye. That's... you
remember the Battle of Haroquin?

1064
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:15.100
When I got hit in the
face with a broadsword?

1065
01:29:18.702 --> 01:29:21.750
You're not the Thor I
know at all, are you?

1066
01:29:21.759 --> 01:29:23.479
Yes, I am.

1067
01:29:23.707 --> 01:29:26.513
The future hasn't been
kind to you, has it?

1068
01:29:26.677 --> 01:29:29.011
I didn't say I'm
from the future.

1069
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:31.522
I was raised by witches, boy.

1070
01:29:32.429 --> 01:29:35.610
I see with more than
eyes, and you know that.

1071
01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:39.657
I am totally, totally
from the future!

1072
01:29:39.683 --> 01:29:40.724
Yes, you are.

1073
01:29:41.386 --> 01:29:44.192
- I really need to talk to you.
- We can talk.

1074
01:30:08.345 --> 01:30:10.127
His head was over there...

1075
01:30:10.839 --> 01:30:12.504
His body over there...

1076
01:30:14.358 --> 01:30:16.599
What was the point.
I was too late.

1077
01:30:17.655 --> 01:30:19.233
I was just standing there.

1078
01:30:20.555 --> 01:30:23.510
- Some idiot with an ax.
- You're no idiot.

1079
01:30:24.973 --> 01:30:29.483
You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1080
01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:32.345
- I guess, yeah.
- Idiot? No.

1081
01:30:32.462 --> 01:30:36.643
- A failure? Absolutely.
- That's a little bit harsh.

1082
01:30:36.698 --> 01:30:39.395
You do know what
that makes you?

1083
01:30:39.546 --> 01:30:41.859
Just like everyone else.

1084
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.041
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1085
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.714
Everyone fails at who they
are supposed to be, Thor.

1086
01:30:49.391 --> 01:30:52.498
The measure of a
person, of a hero

1087
01:30:52.582 --> 01:30:55.943
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1088
01:31:01.125 --> 01:31:02.946
I really missed you, Mum.

1089
01:31:08.605 --> 01:31:10.566
Thor! I got it!

1090
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.895
Get that rabbit!

1091
01:31:15.655 --> 01:31:19.056
- Ma, I have to tell you something.
- No, son. You don't.

1092
01:31:19.456 --> 01:31:22.285
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1093
01:31:22.317 --> 01:31:26.084
- But this is about your future.
- It's none of my business.

1094
01:31:29.408 --> 01:31:30.408
Hey.

1095
01:31:30.563 --> 01:31:32.095
You must be Mom.

1096
01:31:32.901 --> 01:31:34.846
I got the thing. Come
on, we got to move.

1097
01:31:34.871 --> 01:31:38.366
- I wish we had more time.
- This was a gift.

1098
01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.147
And you're going to be the
man you're meant to be.

1099
01:31:42.195 --> 01:31:45.142
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

1100
01:31:48.386 --> 01:31:49.918
And eat a salad.

1101
01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:53.335
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Goodbye.

1102
01:31:53.351 --> 01:31:56.133
- Three... two...
- No, wait!

1103
01:31:59.151 --> 01:32:00.284
Wh- what am I looking at?

1104
01:32:00.309 --> 01:32:02.630
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

1105
01:32:11.637 --> 01:32:13.138
I'm still worthy.

1106
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:15.804
Oh, boy.

1107
01:32:17.383 --> 01:32:19.368
Goodbye, Mom.

1108
01:32:58.537 --> 01:33:00.030
So he's an idiot?

1109
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:02.300
Yeah

1110
01:33:11.428 --> 01:33:12.615
What's that?

1111
01:33:12.656 --> 01:33:14.273
The tool of a thief.

1112
01:33:22.372 --> 01:33:23.906
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

1113
01:33:24.376 --> 01:33:28.083
This is the part where spikes come out,
with skeletons on the end and everything...

1114
01:33:28.108 --> 01:33:29.021
What are you talking about?

1115
01:33:29.046 --> 01:33:31.674
When you break into a place called
the temple of the Power Stone,

1116
01:33:31.699 --> 01:33:35.514
There's gonna be a bunch of booby
traps--- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1117
01:34:08.683 --> 01:34:10.457
I wasn't always like this.

1118
01:34:11.361 --> 01:34:12.567
Me either.

1119
01:34:13.893 --> 01:34:16.102
But we work with
what we got, right?

1120
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:20.433
Sync up.

1121
01:34:22.637 --> 01:34:25.053
Three.. two.. one...

1122
01:34:37.986 --> 01:34:39.463
You murdered trillions!

1123
01:34:39.488 --> 01:34:41.225
You should be grateful.

1124
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:45.900
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

1125
01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:49.972
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

1126
01:34:50.063 --> 01:34:55.057
I used the stones to destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.

1127
01:34:55.214 --> 01:34:59.279
But the work is done.
It always will be.

1128
01:35:00.459 --> 01:35:04.243
I am inevitable.

1129
01:35:05.221 --> 01:35:11.092
- What did you do to them?
- Nothing. Yet.

1130
01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:16.225
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1131
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:20.242
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1132
01:35:20.492 --> 01:35:22.047
The stones...

1133
01:35:22.992 --> 01:35:24.791
I found them all.

1134
01:35:26.478 --> 01:35:27.729
I won.

1135
01:35:28.792 --> 01:35:31.766
Tipped the cosmic
scales to balance.

1136
01:35:35.925 --> 01:35:37.332
This is your future.

1137
01:35:37.895 --> 01:35:39.380
It's my destiny.

1138
01:35:41.124 --> 01:35:45.102
My father is many things. A
liar is not one of them.

1139
01:35:48.787 --> 01:35:50.133
Thank you, Daughter.

1140
01:35:50.492 --> 01:35:53.588
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

1141
01:35:57.594 --> 01:36:00.361
And that, is destiny fulfilled.

1142
01:36:01.073 --> 01:36:04.364
Sire, your Daughter...

1143
01:36:05.973 --> 01:36:06.974
No...

1144
01:36:07.427 --> 01:36:08.716
...is a traitor.

1145
01:36:08.741 --> 01:36:13.400
That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.

1146
01:36:20.458 --> 01:36:21.669
I know.

1147
01:36:22.496 --> 01:36:25.217
And you'll have the
chance to prove it.

1148
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:33.109
No...

1149
01:36:33.672 --> 01:36:35.001
He knows!

1150
01:36:39.284 --> 01:36:42.043
Barton? Barton, come in.

1151
01:36:42.106 --> 01:36:46.335
Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem.
Come on!

1152
01:36:46.735 --> 01:36:48.118
Come in, we have a prob....

1153
01:36:48.345 --> 01:36:50.198
Thanos knows.

1154
01:36:50.308 --> 01:36:51.614
Thanos...

1155
01:37:05.665 --> 01:37:06.666
Cap...

1156
01:37:08.253 --> 01:37:10.320
Sorry, buddy.
We got a problem.

1157
01:37:10.363 --> 01:37:12.857
Huh. Yeah, we do.

1158
01:37:13.123 --> 01:37:15.405
- Well, what are we gonna do now?
- You know what, give me a break, Steve.

1159
01:37:15.431 --> 01:37:17.119
I just got hit in the
head with a Hulk.

1160
01:37:17.253 --> 01:37:20.199
You said that we had one shot.
This, this was our shot.

1161
01:37:20.224 --> 01:37:22.892
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.
Six stones or nothing.

1162
01:37:22.918 --> 01:37:25.004
You're repeating yourself, you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1163
01:37:25.029 --> 01:37:26.810
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1164
01:37:26.835 --> 01:37:27.719
- No!
- Come on.

1165
01:37:27.744 --> 01:37:30.041
You never wanted a time heist, you
went on board with the time heist...

1166
01:37:30.066 --> 01:37:31.433
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1167
01:37:31.458 --> 01:37:32.675
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah!

1168
01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.613
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1169
01:37:34.622 --> 01:37:36.357
No, no, no. There's
no other options.

1170
01:37:36.405 --> 01:37:38.531
There's no do-overs. We're
not going anywhere else.

1171
01:37:38.562 --> 01:37:41.008
We have one particle left. Each.

1172
01:37:41.033 --> 01:37:44.699
That's it, alright? We use that...
Bye, bye. You're not going home.

1173
01:37:44.742 --> 01:37:46.932
Yeah, well if we don't try...

1174
01:37:46.989 --> 01:37:48.777
then no one else is
going home, either.

1175
01:37:48.802 --> 01:37:49.958
I got it.

1176
01:37:50.356 --> 01:37:54.718
There's another way. To retake the
Tesseract and acquire new particles.

1177
01:37:55.492 --> 01:37:59.292
We'll stroll down memory lane.
Military installation, Garden State.

1178
01:38:02.965 --> 01:38:04.356
Why were they both there?

1179
01:38:04.381 --> 01:38:07.593
They were there at a...I've
a vaguely exact idea.

1180
01:38:07.617 --> 01:38:08.414
How vague?

1181
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:09.869
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?

1182
01:38:09.894 --> 01:38:11.098
- I know for a fact they were there...
- Who's they?

1183
01:38:11.121 --> 01:38:13.847
- What are we doing?
- And I know how I know.

1184
01:38:14.746 --> 01:38:16.809
Guys, what's up? What is it?

1185
01:38:16.975 --> 01:38:18.763
Well, it looks like
we're improvising.

1186
01:38:18.788 --> 01:38:20.287
- Right.
- What are we improvising?

1187
01:38:20.312 --> 01:38:22.407
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1188
01:38:22.432 --> 01:38:23.143
Suit up.

1189
01:38:23.175 --> 01:38:24.322
What's in New Jersey?

1190
01:38:24.348 --> 01:38:26.223
- 0-4, 0-4...
- Uhh, 0-7.

1191
01:38:26.248 --> 01:38:27.317
- 0-7.
- Excuse me...

1192
01:38:27.343 --> 01:38:28.827
1-9-7-0.

1193
01:38:29.383 --> 01:38:33.737
- Are you sure?
- Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry.

1194
01:38:34.101 --> 01:38:37.001
America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this,

1195
01:38:37.036 --> 01:38:40.053
and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1196
01:38:40.898 --> 01:38:43.099
Thanks for the pep
talk, pissant.

1197
01:38:43.712 --> 01:38:44.978
You trust me?

1198
01:38:45.494 --> 01:38:46.620
I do.

1199
01:38:48.098 --> 01:38:49.356
Your call.

1200
01:38:50.271 --> 01:38:51.647
Here we go.

1201
01:39:07.799 --> 01:39:09.245
Hey, man!

1202
01:39:09.546 --> 01:39:11.077
Make love, not war!

1203
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.404
Clearly, you weren't
actually born here, right?

1204
01:39:20.429 --> 01:39:22.044
The idea of me was.

1205
01:39:22.795 --> 01:39:25.358
Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a

1206
01:39:25.383 --> 01:39:28.274
quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization.

1207
01:39:29.323 --> 01:39:30.463
Where do you hide it?

1208
01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:32.137
In plain sight.

1209
01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.603
Good luck on your
mission, Captain.

1210
01:40:02.628 --> 01:40:04.873
Good luck on your
project, doctor.

1211
01:40:08.532 --> 01:40:09.876
You're new here?

1212
01:40:12.096 --> 01:40:13.300
Not exactly.

1213
01:40:28.782 --> 01:40:29.992
Gotcha.

1214
01:40:47.811 --> 01:40:49.195
Back in the game.

1215
01:40:52.205 --> 01:40:53.964
Arnim, you in there?

1216
01:40:54.277 --> 01:40:55.425
Arnim?

1217
01:41:00.656 --> 01:41:01.656
Hey!

1218
01:41:02.032 --> 01:41:03.954
The door's this way, pal.

1219
01:41:05.018 --> 01:41:06.073
Oh, yeah.

1220
01:41:06.341 --> 01:41:08.114
I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?

1221
01:41:08.139 --> 01:41:11.976
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,
I haven't seen a soul.

1222
01:41:13.206 --> 01:41:14.394
Pardon me.

1223
01:41:15.309 --> 01:41:16.810
Do I know you?

1224
01:41:18.256 --> 01:41:20.303
No, sir. I'm, a...

1225
01:41:20.726 --> 01:41:22.219
visitor from MIT.

1226
01:41:22.359 --> 01:41:24.079
Huh. MIT.

1227
01:41:24.689 --> 01:41:25.995
Got a name?

1228
01:41:26.386 --> 01:41:27.450
Howard.

1229
01:41:27.475 --> 01:41:29.091
Well that'll be
easy to remember.

1230
01:41:29.107 --> 01:41:30.584
Howard...

1231
01:41:31.248 --> 01:41:32.460
...Potts.

1232
01:41:32.485 --> 01:41:34.445
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1233
01:41:35.078 --> 01:41:35.915
Hi.

1234
01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:37.259
Shit. Now, don't pull it.

1235
01:41:37.315 --> 01:41:38.316
Yeah...

1236
01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:42.178
You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.

1237
01:41:42.233 --> 01:41:44.108
I'm fine. Just, long hours.

1238
01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.336
Wanna get some air?

1239
01:41:48.846 --> 01:41:51.590
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah. That would be swell.

1240
01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:53.044
- That way.
- Okay.

1241
01:41:53.263 --> 01:41:54.842
Need your briefcase?

1242
01:41:59.595 --> 01:42:01.956
You're not one of
those, are ya, Potts?

1243
01:42:07.811 --> 01:42:09.554
- Hello.
- Dr. Pym?

1244
01:42:09.579 --> 01:42:12.222
That would be the number
that you called. Yes.

1245
01:42:12.247 --> 01:42:14.645
This is Capt. Stevens
from shipping.

1246
01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:17.224
- We have a package for you.
- Bring it up.

1247
01:42:17.249 --> 01:42:19.665
Well, that's the thing, sir.
We can't.

1248
01:42:20.531 --> 01:42:23.158
I'm confused. I thought
that was your job.

1249
01:42:23.306 --> 01:42:26.589
Well, it's just... Sir,
the box is glowing and,

1250
01:42:26.614 --> 01:42:29.303
to be honest, some of our mail
guys aren't feeling that great.

1251
01:42:29.328 --> 01:42:31.077
They didn't know
better, did they?

1252
01:42:31.102 --> 01:42:33.689
Yeah, they did. You
better get down here.

1253
01:42:34.284 --> 01:42:36.817
Excuse me. Out of the way!

1254
01:43:03.406 --> 01:43:06.853
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?

1255
01:43:07.537 --> 01:43:09.203
My wife's expecting.

1256
01:43:09.477 --> 01:43:12.073
And, uh... Too much
time in the office.

1257
01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:16.315
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Hold this, will you?

1258
01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:17.950
Yeah, sure.

1259
01:43:18.713 --> 01:43:21.011
- How far along is she?
- I don't know... uh...

1260
01:43:22.612 --> 01:43:25.653
She's at the point where she can't
stand the sound of my chewing.

1261
01:43:25.723 --> 01:43:28.717
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

1262
01:43:29.731 --> 01:43:31.070
I have a little girl.

1263
01:43:31.095 --> 01:43:34.918
A girl would be nice. Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1264
01:43:35.466 --> 01:43:37.042
What'd be so awful about that?

1265
01:43:37.067 --> 01:43:40.398
Let's just say that the greater
good has rarely outweighed

1266
01:43:41.155 --> 01:43:43.343
my own self-interests.

1267
01:43:46.244 --> 01:43:48.636
- And you've never seen these 2 men before?
- No, I've got an eye for this.

1268
01:43:48.661 --> 01:43:50.554
- The 2 of them looked fishy.
- Can you describe them?

1269
01:43:50.579 --> 01:43:53.932
- Well, one of them had a hippie beard.
- Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1270
01:43:53.957 --> 01:43:55.022
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1271
01:43:55.047 --> 01:43:57.228
Yeah, this is Chesler. I
need every available MPs

1272
01:43:57.253 --> 01:43:59.503
on sub-level 6. We have
a potential breach.

1273
01:45:01.337 --> 01:45:03.041
So, where are you
at with names?

1274
01:45:03.066 --> 01:45:06.122
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Almanzo.

1275
01:45:07.068 --> 01:45:09.350
Might wanna let that stew on.
You got time.

1276
01:45:11.181 --> 01:45:13.162
Let me ask you a question.

1277
01:45:13.617 --> 01:45:15.782
When your kid was born...

1278
01:45:16.068 --> 01:45:19.135
- were you nervous?
- Wildly. Yeah.

1279
01:45:19.159 --> 01:45:20.542
Did you feel qualified?

1280
01:45:20.567 --> 01:45:24.123
Like you had any idea how to
successfully operate that thing?

1281
01:45:24.316 --> 01:45:27.396
I literally pieced it
together as I went along,

1282
01:45:27.451 --> 01:45:30.054
I thought about what
my Dad did, and...

1283
01:45:30.257 --> 01:45:33.157
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1284
01:45:33.282 --> 01:45:35.377
I thought my Dad
was tough on me.

1285
01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:38.409
And now, looking back, I just
remember the good stuff, you know.

1286
01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:41.598
- He did drop the odd pearl.
- Yeah? Like what?

1287
01:45:42.509 --> 01:45:45.261
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

1288
01:45:46.324 --> 01:45:47.716
Smart guy.

1289
01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.161
He did his best.

1290
01:45:50.599 --> 01:45:52.366
Let me tell you. That
kid's not even here yet

1291
01:45:52.392 --> 01:45:54.720
and, there's nothing I
wouldn't do for him.

1292
01:46:03.017 --> 01:46:04.455
Good to meet you, Potts.

1293
01:46:05.417 --> 01:46:07.645
Yeah, Howard...

1294
01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:10.549
Everything's gonna be all right.

1295
01:46:12.755 --> 01:46:16.265
Thank you for everything...

1296
01:46:16.524 --> 01:46:19.110
...you've done for
this country.

1297
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:23.035
Jarvis.

1298
01:46:26.733 --> 01:46:28.405
Have we ever met that guy?

1299
01:46:35.661 --> 01:46:37.489
Seems very familiar.

1300
01:46:37.279 --> 01:46:38.826
Weird beard, though.

1301
01:46:46.962 --> 01:46:49.700
- You're weak.
- I'm you.

1302
01:47:07.151 --> 01:47:08.612
You can stop this.

1303
01:47:09.363 --> 01:47:11.169
You know you want to.

1304
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:14.842
Did you see what
happens in the future?

1305
01:47:15.516 --> 01:47:18.002
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1306
01:47:19.417 --> 01:47:21.551
You wanna know
how he does that?

1307
01:47:22.646 --> 01:47:27.406
You wanna know, what
he does to you?

1308
01:47:27.554 --> 01:47:28.923
That's enough.

1309
01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.506
You disgust me.

1310
01:47:43.968 --> 01:47:48.619
But, that doesn't
mean you're useless.

1311
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:12.250
How do I look?

1312
01:48:19.005 --> 01:48:20.006
Wow...

1313
01:48:20.811 --> 01:48:23.155
Under different circumstances,

1314
01:48:24.013 --> 01:48:26.251
this would be totally awesome.

1315
01:48:38.176 --> 01:48:41.303
I bet the raccoon didn't
have to climb a mountain.

1316
01:48:41.434 --> 01:48:43.420
Technically, he's not
a raccoon, you know.

1317
01:48:43.445 --> 01:48:45.064
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1318
01:48:45.358 --> 01:48:46.359
Welcome.

1319
01:48:49.713 --> 01:48:52.433
Natasha, daughter of Ivan.

1320
01:48:53.432 --> 01:48:56.364
Clint, son of Edith.

1321
01:49:02.551 --> 01:49:03.668
Who are you?

1322
01:49:04.685 --> 01:49:06.881
Consider me a guide.

1323
01:49:07.223 --> 01:49:10.830
To you, and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.

1324
01:49:10.936 --> 01:49:14.367
Okay. You tell us where it is.
Then we'll be on our way.

1325
01:49:18.136 --> 01:49:20.089
If only it were that easy.

1326
01:49:32.621 --> 01:49:35.545
What you seek lies
in front of you...

1327
01:49:37.555 --> 01:49:39.376
...as does what you fear.

1328
01:49:45.055 --> 01:49:46.656
The stone is down there.

1329
01:49:47.447 --> 01:49:48.604
For one of you.

1330
01:49:49.793 --> 01:49:50.989
For the other...

1331
01:49:53.999 --> 01:49:58.455
In order to take the stone, you
must lose that which you love.

1332
01:50:00.423 --> 01:50:02.604
An everlasting exchange.

1333
01:50:04.676 --> 01:50:07.701
A soul, for a soul.

1334
01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.587
How's it going?

1335
01:50:16.223 --> 01:50:17.223
Jesus...

1336
01:50:17.864 --> 01:50:20.006
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1337
01:50:20.233 --> 01:50:23.642
No. I don't think so.

1338
01:50:24.431 --> 01:50:26.479
Why, 'cause he knows
your Daddy's name?

1339
01:50:28.122 --> 01:50:29.238
I didn't.

1340
01:50:30.434 --> 01:50:32.561
Thanos left here with the stone

1341
01:50:33.656 --> 01:50:37.143
without his daughter.
It's not a coincidence.

1342
01:50:38.534 --> 01:50:39.535
Yeah.

1343
01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:43.663
Whatever it takes.

1344
01:50:48.205 --> 01:50:49.487
Whatever it takes.

1345
01:50:54.013 --> 01:50:57.961
If we don't get that stone,
billions of people stay dead.

1346
01:51:01.694 --> 01:51:04.242
Then I guess we both
know who it's gotta be.

1347
01:51:04.603 --> 01:51:06.056
I guess we do.

1348
01:51:12.838 --> 01:51:17.263
I'm starting to think, we've been
different people here, Natasha.

1349
01:51:17.678 --> 01:51:21.086
For the last five years I've been trying
to do one thing: Get to right here.

1350
01:51:21.164 --> 01:51:23.438
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1351
01:51:23.463 --> 01:51:28.012
- Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.
- What, you think I wanna do it?

1352
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:30.425
I'm trying to save
your life, you idiot.

1353
01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:32.599
Yeah well, I don't want
you to, because I...

1354
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:35.792
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1355
01:51:37.265 --> 01:51:39.531
You know what I've become.

1356
01:51:41.337 --> 01:51:44.018
I don't judge people on
their worst mistakes.

1357
01:51:48.209 --> 01:51:49.546
Maybe you should.

1358
01:51:50.421 --> 01:51:51.516
You didn't.

1359
01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.343
You're a pain in my
ass, you know that?

1360
01:52:11.234 --> 01:52:12.375
Okay.

1361
01:52:14.361 --> 01:52:15.596
You win.

1362
01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:24.061
Tell my family I love them.

1363
01:52:27.026 --> 01:52:28.582
You tell them yourself.

1364
01:53:01.357 --> 01:53:02.483
Damn you!

1365
01:53:18.699 --> 01:53:19.943
Let me go.

1366
01:53:21.839 --> 01:53:22.840
No.

1367
01:53:24.902 --> 01:53:26.029
Please, no.

1368
01:53:28.927 --> 01:53:30.521
It's okay.

1369
01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:34.247
Please...

1370
01:55:18.213 --> 01:55:19.511
Did we get them all?

1371
01:55:20.128 --> 01:55:22.528
You telling me this'll
actually work?

1372
01:55:27.248 --> 01:55:28.811
Clint, where's Nat?

1373
01:55:58.016 --> 01:55:59.950
Do we know if she had family?

1374
01:56:00.049 --> 01:56:02.214
Yeah. Us.

1375
01:56:03.786 --> 01:56:04.934
What?

1376
01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:08.492
I just asked him a question...

1377
01:56:08.517 --> 01:56:10.641
Yeah, you're acting like she's dead.
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1378
01:56:10.666 --> 01:56:12.574
We have the stones, right?
As long as we have

1379
01:56:12.599 --> 01:56:14.935
the stones, Cap, we can bring
her back, isn't that right?

1380
01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:17.305
So stop this shit. We're the
Avengers, get it together.

1381
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:19.141
We can't get her back.

1382
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:25.936
- Wha- what?
- It can't be undone. It can't.

1383
01:56:28.542 --> 01:56:32.407
I'm sorry. No offense, but you're
a very earthly being. Okay?

1384
01:56:32.432 --> 01:56:35.825
We're talking about space magic.
And "can't" seems very () don't you think?

1385
01:56:35.856 --> 01:56:38.858
Look, I know that I'm way
outside my paygrade here.

1386
01:56:38.866 --> 01:56:40.429
But she still isn't
here, is she?

1387
01:56:40.454 --> 01:56:44.385
- Now that's my point.
- It can't be undone.

1388
01:56:44.893 --> 01:56:48.246
Or that's at least what the,
great floating guy had to say.

1389
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:49.918
Maybe you wanna go talk to him?
Okay?

1390
01:56:49.943 --> 01:56:53.383
Go grab your hammer, and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1391
01:57:01.399 --> 01:57:03.399
It was supposed to be me.

1392
01:57:06.058 --> 01:57:10.108
She sacrificed her life for that
goddamned stone. She bet her life on it.

1393
01:57:14.661 --> 01:57:16.568
She's not coming back.

1394
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:21.720
We have to make it worth it.
We have to.

1395
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:24.868
We will.

1396
01:57:50.146 --> 01:57:51.225
Boom!

1397
01:57:56.737 --> 01:57:58.675
All right. The glove's ready.

1398
01:57:59.112 --> 01:58:01.848
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freaking fingers?

1399
01:58:02.262 --> 01:58:03.262
I'll do it.

1400
01:58:03.850 --> 01:58:04.850
It's okay.

1401
01:58:04.874 --> 01:58:06.648
- No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop.
- Hey, hey...

1402
01:58:06.665 --> 01:58:07.641
Thor, just wait.

1403
01:58:07.666 --> 01:58:09.878
We haven't decided who's
gonna put that on yet.

1404
01:58:10.371 --> 01:58:13.279
I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1405
01:58:13.326 --> 01:58:14.639
We should at least discuss it.

1406
01:58:14.648 --> 01:58:18.493
Look, us sitting here staring at that
thing is not gonna bring everybody back.

1407
01:58:19.522 --> 01:58:22.699
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So
this responsibility falls upon me.

1408
01:58:22.724 --> 01:58:27.892
It's my duty. It's not that... It's...
stop it! Just let me.

1409
01:58:30.391 --> 01:58:34.050
Just let me do it. Just
let me do something good.

1410
01:58:34.075 --> 01:58:34.894
- Something great.
- Look...

1411
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:36.849
It's not just the fact that
that glove is channeling

1412
01:58:36.874 --> 01:58:39.577
enough energy to light up a
continent, I'm telling you

1413
01:58:39.601 --> 01:58:40.602
you're in no condition.

1414
01:58:40.641 --> 01:58:43.932
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1415
01:58:43.957 --> 01:58:45.175
Cheez Whiz?

1416
01:58:47.859 --> 01:58:49.529
- Lightning.
- Yeah.

1417
01:58:49.587 --> 01:58:51.501
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1418
01:58:51.565 --> 01:58:52.940
It's gotta be me.

1419
01:58:54.653 --> 01:58:58.139
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.
It almost killed him.

1420
01:59:00.117 --> 01:59:01.938
None of you could survive.

1421
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:04.336
How do we know you will?

1422
01:59:04.352 --> 01:59:08.105
I don't. But the
radiation's mostly gamma.

1423
01:59:11.503 --> 01:59:12.856
It's like...

1424
01:59:15.161 --> 01:59:16.897
I was meant for this.

1425
01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:37.770
Good to go, yeah?

1426
01:59:39.537 --> 01:59:40.959
Let's do it.

1427
01:59:41.101 --> 01:59:43.179
You remember everyone
Thanos snapped away five

1428
01:59:43.204 --> 01:59:46.042
years ago and just bringing
them back to now, today.

1429
01:59:46.751 --> 01:59:49.143
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1430
01:59:49.292 --> 01:59:50.293
Got it.

1431
02:00:07.147 --> 02:00:09.922
Friday, do me a favor and
activate protocol 8.

1432
02:00:09.962 --> 02:00:11.110
Yes, boss.

1433
02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:21.421
Everybody comes home.

1434
02:00:44.815 --> 02:00:48.184
- Take it off. Take it off!
- No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1435
02:00:48.810 --> 02:00:50.154
Talk to me, Banner.

1436
02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:56.222
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1437
02:01:27.682 --> 02:01:28.703
Bruce!

1438
02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:31.893
Don't move him.

1439
02:01:38.981 --> 02:01:41.756
- Did it work?
- Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.

1440
02:02:27.329 --> 02:02:28.275
Honey.

1441
02:02:29.519 --> 02:02:30.520
Honey.

1442
02:02:31.825 --> 02:02:32.826
Guys...

1443
02:02:35.627 --> 02:02:37.346
I think it worked!

1444
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:21.067
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!
I can't breathe.

1445
02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:24.647
Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.

1446
02:03:31.074 --> 02:03:33.350
Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!

1447
02:03:33.925 --> 02:03:35.457
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1448
02:03:35.769 --> 02:03:36.865
Come on!

1449
02:03:46.957 --> 02:03:48.348
Rhodey!

1450
02:03:56.542 --> 02:04:00.349
Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're
in the lower level, it's flooding!

1451
02:04:00.381 --> 02:04:03.916
- What?
- We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1452
02:04:04.035 --> 02:04:07.999
Wait! I'm here! I'm
here, can you hear me?

1453
02:04:27.583 --> 02:04:28.583
Cap?

1454
02:05:13.214 --> 02:05:14.215
Daughter.

1455
02:05:14.278 --> 02:05:15.591
Yes, Father.

1456
02:05:17.522 --> 02:05:20.774
So, this is the future.
Well done.

1457
02:05:21.283 --> 02:05:24.831
Thank you, Father. They
suspected nothing.

1458
02:05:26.919 --> 02:05:29.139
The arrogant never do.

1459
02:05:31.219 --> 02:05:32.220
Go.

1460
02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:35.728
Find the stones.
Bring them to me.

1461
02:05:35.994 --> 02:05:37.386
What will you do?

1462
02:05:38.856 --> 02:05:39.982
Wait.

1463
02:06:05.983 --> 02:06:07.875
Tell me something.

1464
02:06:08.531 --> 02:06:12.916
In the future, what
happens to you and me?

1465
02:06:15.459 --> 02:06:16.936
I tried to kill you.

1466
02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:19.992
Several times.

1467
02:06:21.455 --> 02:06:24.714
But eventually,
we become friends.

1468
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:28.662
We become sisters.

1469
02:06:36.187 --> 02:06:37.420
Come on.

1470
02:06:39.314 --> 02:06:40.784
We can stop him.

1471
02:06:49.386 --> 02:06:50.987
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

1472
02:06:51.185 --> 02:06:52.583
That's my man.

1473
02:06:53.678 --> 02:06:56.164
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1474
02:06:59.104 --> 02:07:00.472
What happened?

1475
02:07:00.657 --> 02:07:02.806
We messed with time.
It tends to mess back.

1476
02:07:02.831 --> 02:07:03.832
You'll see.

1477
02:07:25.624 --> 02:07:27.476
What's he been doing?

1478
02:07:28.992 --> 02:07:30.579
Absolutely nothing.

1479
02:07:32.284 --> 02:07:33.800
Where are the stones?

1480
02:07:34.323 --> 02:07:36.286
Lost somewhere under all this.

1481
02:07:37.506 --> 02:07:39.812
All I know is he
doesn't have them.

1482
02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:41.734
So we keep it that way.

1483
02:07:41.759 --> 02:07:44.214
- You know it's a trap, right?
- Yeah...

1484
02:07:44.909 --> 02:07:46.386
I don't much care.

1485
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:47.950
Good.

1486
02:07:49.107 --> 02:07:51.709
Just as long as we're
all in agreement.

1487
02:08:01.381 --> 02:08:03.650
Let's kill him
properly this time.

1488
02:08:12.679 --> 02:08:15.414
You could not live
with your own failure.

1489
02:08:17.135 --> 02:08:18.902
Where did that bring you?

1490
02:08:22.038 --> 02:08:23.360
Back to me.

1491
02:08:27.292 --> 02:08:29.895
I thought by eliminating
half of life,

1492
02:08:30.715 --> 02:08:32.981
the other half would thrive.

1493
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:37.861
But you've shown me,
that's impossible.

1494
02:08:39.491 --> 02:08:42.876
And as long as there are those
that remember what was,

1495
02:08:42.901 --> 02:08:48.147
there will always be those that
are unable to accept what can be.

1496
02:08:48.842 --> 02:08:50.257
They will resist.

1497
02:08:50.554 --> 02:08:52.756
Yep. We're all
kinds of stubborn.

1498
02:08:53.486 --> 02:08:55.112
I'm thankful.

1499
02:08:57.278 --> 02:09:01.186
Because now, I know
what I must do.

1500
02:09:01.859 --> 02:09:07.119
I will shred this universe
down to its last atom.

1501
02:09:07.902 --> 02:09:09.317
And then...

1502
02:09:09.642 --> 02:09:14.535
With the stones you've collected
for me, create a new one.

1503
02:09:15.068 --> 02:09:16.866
Teeming with life,

1504
02:09:17.227 --> 02:09:21.886
but knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given.

1505
02:09:24.652 --> 02:09:26.262
A grateful universe.

1506
02:09:26.784 --> 02:09:28.255
Born out of blood.

1507
02:09:28.412 --> 02:09:30.085
They'll never know it.

1508
02:09:31.116 --> 02:09:33.785
Because you won't be
alive to tell them.

1509
02:09:49.025 --> 02:09:50.635
See you on the other side, man.

1510
02:09:52.262 --> 02:09:54.497
Hang on! I'm coming!

1511
02:10:40.445 --> 02:10:41.931
Oh, hey...

1512
02:10:41.986 --> 02:10:43.690
I know you.

1513
02:10:46.926 --> 02:10:50.162
Father. I have the stones.

1514
02:10:50.241 --> 02:10:51.242
What?!

1515
02:10:52.469 --> 02:10:53.578
Stop.

1516
02:10:58.534 --> 02:11:00.355
You're betraying us?

1517
02:11:06.063 --> 02:11:07.931
You don't have to do this.

1518
02:11:10.198 --> 02:11:13.121
I am... this.

1519
02:11:13.153 --> 02:11:15.006
No, you're not.

1520
02:11:15.170 --> 02:11:17.218
You've seen what we become.

1521
02:11:23.265 --> 02:11:24.720
Nebula, listen to her.

1522
02:11:27.074 --> 02:11:28.347
You can change.

1523
02:11:34.530 --> 02:11:35.883
He won't let me.

1524
02:11:37.657 --> 02:11:38.657
No!

1525
02:11:57.916 --> 02:11:59.918
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1526
02:12:15.889 --> 02:12:17.398
Boss, wake up.

1527
02:13:08.514 --> 02:13:09.749
I knew it!

1528
02:14:32.608 --> 02:14:34.946
In all my years of conquest...

1529
02:14:36.213 --> 02:14:37.456
violence...

1530
02:14:39.168 --> 02:14:40.356
slaughter...

1531
02:14:42.256 --> 02:14:43.890
It was never personal.

1532
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:49.057
But I'll tell you now...

1533
02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:54.035
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

1534
02:14:54.846 --> 02:14:57.074
annoying little planet...

1535
02:14:59.317 --> 02:15:04.124
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Very, very much.

1536
02:16:08.585 --> 02:16:10.093
Cap, you hear me?

1537
02:16:15.585 --> 02:16:17.946
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

1538
02:16:22.187 --> 02:16:23.438
On your left.

1539
02:17:49.057 --> 02:17:50.424
Is that everyone?

1540
02:17:50.722 --> 02:17:52.254
What, you wanted more?

1541
02:18:19.375 --> 02:18:20.821
Avengers...

1542
02:18:26.298 --> 02:18:27.556
... assemble.

1543
02:19:24.350 --> 02:19:25.866
No, no. Give me that.

1544
02:19:25.904 --> 02:19:27.477
You have the little one.

1545
02:19:41.014 --> 02:19:42.015
Hey!

1546
02:19:42.930 --> 02:19:43.961
Holy cow.

1547
02:19:44.009 --> 02:19:47.229
You will not believe what's been going on.
Do you remember when we were in space?

1548
02:19:47.254 --> 02:19:50.966
And I got all dusty? I must've passed
out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone.

1549
02:19:50.991 --> 02:19:52.960
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
He was like,

1550
02:19:52.985 --> 02:19:54.864
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us!"

1551
02:19:54.889 --> 02:19:57.396
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time...

1552
02:19:57.421 --> 02:19:59.132
What are you doing?

1553
02:20:03.745 --> 02:20:04.902
This is nice.

1554
02:20:27.086 --> 02:20:28.345
Gamora?

1555
02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:38.955
I thought I lost you.

1556
02:20:43.747 --> 02:20:46.483
Don't... touch... me!

1557
02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:51.226
You missed the first time...

1558
02:20:51.798 --> 02:20:54.330
then you got them
both the second time.

1559
02:20:55.926 --> 02:20:58.200
This is the one? Seriously?

1560
02:20:58.269 --> 02:21:00.450
The choices were him, or a tree.

1561
02:21:11.107 --> 02:21:14.429
Cap, what do you want me to
do with this damn thing?

1562
02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:18.760
Get those stones as
far away as possible!

1563
02:21:18.777 --> 02:21:19.894
No!

1564
02:21:20.903 --> 02:21:23.202
We need to get them back
where they came from.

1565
02:21:23.227 --> 02:21:25.868
No way to get them back. Thanos
destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1566
02:21:25.931 --> 02:21:27.033
Hold on!

1567
02:21:28.315 --> 02:21:30.644
That wasn't our
only time machine.

1568
02:21:36.589 --> 02:21:38.834
Anyone see an ugly
brown van up there?

1569
02:21:39.084 --> 02:21:39.865
Yes!

1570
02:21:39.912 --> 02:21:42.178
But you're not gonna
like where it's parked.

1571
02:21:42.203 --> 02:21:45.454
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

1572
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:47.030
Maybe ten minutes.

1573
02:21:47.034 --> 02:21:48.840
Get it started. We'll
get the stones to you.

1574
02:21:48.865 --> 02:21:50.373
We're on it, Cap.

1575
02:22:00.099 --> 02:22:01.100
Hey.

1576
02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:04.398
You said one out of 14
million, we win, yeah?

1577
02:22:05.445 --> 02:22:06.445
Tell me this is it.

1578
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:10.097
If I tell you what
happens, it won't happen.

1579
02:22:13.762 --> 02:22:15.325
You better be right.

1580
02:22:23.119 --> 02:22:24.587
It's a mess back here.

1581
02:22:24.997 --> 02:22:27.412
It's... it's dead.

1582
02:22:27.599 --> 02:22:29.060
- What?
- It's dead.

1583
02:22:29.343 --> 02:22:30.969
I have to hotwire it.

1584
02:22:33.642 --> 02:22:35.144
Where's Nebula?

1585
02:22:35.793 --> 02:22:37.666
She's not responding.

1586
02:22:37.742 --> 02:22:38.743
Sire!

1587
02:22:48.755 --> 02:22:49.879
Clint!

1588
02:22:52.118 --> 02:22:53.313
Give it to me.

1589
02:23:15.634 --> 02:23:19.161
You took everything from me.

1590
02:23:19.286 --> 02:23:21.435
I don't even know who you are.

1591
02:23:21.827 --> 02:23:23.053
You will.

1592
02:23:45.618 --> 02:23:46.618
I got it!

1593
02:23:49.253 --> 02:23:50.917
Activate Instant Kill!

1594
02:24:14.328 --> 02:24:15.618
Rain fire!

1595
02:24:15.915 --> 02:24:18.165
But Sire, our troops!

1596
02:24:18.213 --> 02:24:19.471
Just do it!

1597
02:24:40.624 --> 02:24:42.242
Is anyone else seeing this?

1598
02:24:56.095 --> 02:24:57.173
I got this.

1599
02:24:57.376 --> 02:24:58.377
I got this!

1600
02:24:58.432 --> 02:24:59.745
Okay, I don't got this.

1601
02:24:59.753 --> 02:25:03.122
- Help! Somebody, help!
- Hey, Queens. Heads up.

1602
02:25:12.888 --> 02:25:14.756
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1603
02:25:17.679 --> 02:25:18.798
Hey! Nice to meet---

1604
02:25:18.820 --> 02:25:19.899
Oh! My God!

1605
02:25:57.331 --> 02:25:58.754
What the hell is this?

1606
02:25:59.145 --> 02:26:00.535
Friday, what are they firing at?

1607
02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:03.022
Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.

1608
02:26:15.828 --> 02:26:17.392
Oh, yeah!

1609
02:26:37.856 --> 02:26:40.288
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1610
02:26:48.935 --> 02:26:51.303
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

1611
02:26:52.119 --> 02:26:55.307
Hey, Peter Parker. Got
something for me?

1612
02:27:00.946 --> 02:27:04.260
I don't know how you're
gonna get through all that.

1613
02:27:04.909 --> 02:27:06.089
Don't worry.

1614
02:27:07.067 --> 02:27:08.560
She's got help.

1615
02:29:56.316 --> 02:29:59.645
I am inevitable.

1616
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:01.645
*snapped with no effect*

1617
02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:22.138
And I...

1618
02:30:22.305 --> 02:30:24.516
am...

1619
02:30:27.182 --> 02:30:28.480
... Iron Man.

1620
02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:30.480
*SNAPPED*

1621
02:32:26.310 --> 02:32:27.654
Mr. Stark?

1622
02:32:28.529 --> 02:32:29.530
Hey...

1623
02:32:30.687 --> 02:32:33.674
Mr. Stark? Can you hear me?

1624
02:32:33.719 --> 02:32:35.063
It's Peter.

1625
02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:40.677
We won.

1626
02:32:41.053 --> 02:32:42.053
Mr. Stark....

1627
02:32:44.078 --> 02:32:46.063
We won, Mr. Stark.

1628
02:32:47.602 --> 02:32:50.292
We won and you did it, sir.
You did it.

1629
02:32:51.894 --> 02:32:54.232
I'm sorry... Tony...

1630
02:33:07.814 --> 02:33:10.424
- Hey.
- Hey, Pep...

1631
02:33:15.065 --> 02:33:18.613
- Friday?
- Life functions critical.

1632
02:33:27.705 --> 02:33:28.792
Tony.

1633
02:33:30.105 --> 02:33:31.222
Look at me.

1634
02:33:33.748 --> 02:33:35.311
We're gonna be okay.

1635
02:33:40.392 --> 02:33:42.184
You can rest now.

1636
02:35:27.569 --> 02:35:30.110
Everybody wants a
happy ending, right?

1637
02:35:30.766 --> 02:35:33.168
But it doesn't always
roll that way.

1638
02:35:34.941 --> 02:35:36.301
Maybe this time.

1639
02:35:38.224 --> 02:35:40.819
I'm hoping if you
play this back,

1640
02:35:42.414 --> 02:35:44.157
it's in celebration.

1641
02:35:45.033 --> 02:35:47.239
I hope families are reunited,

1642
02:35:47.310 --> 02:35:49.546
I hope we get it back,
and something like a

1643
02:35:49.571 --> 02:35:52.053
normal version of the
planet has been restored.

1644
02:35:52.884 --> 02:35:55.267
If there ever was such a thing.

1645
02:35:55.534 --> 02:35:57.012
God, what a world.

1646
02:35:57.278 --> 02:35:58.989
Universe, now.

1647
02:35:59.646 --> 02:36:01.765
If you told me ten years
ago that we weren't alone,

1648
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:03.289
let alone, you know,
to this extent,

1649
02:36:03.313 --> 02:36:06.916
I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised.
But come on, you know?

1650
02:36:07.245 --> 02:36:11.748
That epic forces of darkness and
light that have come into play.

1651
02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:13.948
And, for better or worse,

1652
02:36:14.112 --> 02:36:17.865
that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.

1653
02:36:21.761 --> 02:36:24.145
So I found the time and I
recorded a little greeting...

1654
02:36:24.233 --> 02:36:27.257
In the case of an untimely death.
On my part.

1655
02:36:27.578 --> 02:36:31.096
Not that, death in any
time isn't untimely.

1656
02:36:31.658 --> 02:36:34.047
This time travel thing that we're
gonna try and pull off tomorrow,

1657
02:36:34.072 --> 02:36:36.300
it's, it's got me scratching
my head about this.

1658
02:36:40.743 --> 02:36:44.128
But then again, that's the hero gig.
Part of the journey is the end.

1659
02:36:47.059 --> 02:36:51.218
Everything's gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.

1660
02:36:54.513 --> 02:36:56.022
I love you 3,000.

1661
02:39:11.261 --> 02:39:13.380
You know, I wish
there was a way...

1662
02:39:13.474 --> 02:39:15.287
that I could let her know.

1663
02:39:17.272 --> 02:39:18.672
That we won.

1664
02:39:20.892 --> 02:39:22.134
We did it.

1665
02:39:26.153 --> 02:39:27.231
She knows.

1666
02:39:32.901 --> 02:39:34.181
They both do.

1667
02:39:43.854 --> 02:39:45.322
How you doing, Squirt?

1668
02:39:45.324 --> 02:39:47.411
- Good.
- You good?

1669
02:39:47.536 --> 02:39:50.272
- Okay. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

1670
02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:54.024
- What do you want?
- Cheeseburgers.

1671
02:39:58.719 --> 02:40:01.666
You know your Dad
liked cheeseburgers?

1672
02:40:05.223 --> 02:40:07.834
I'm gonna get you all the
cheeseburgers you want.

1673
02:40:07.850 --> 02:40:08.851
Okay.

1674
02:40:25.571 --> 02:40:29.308
So, when can we expect you back?

1675
02:40:31.623 --> 02:40:35.515
- About that...
- Thor. Your people need a king.

1676
02:40:35.631 --> 02:40:37.842
No, they already have one.

1677
02:40:39.664 --> 02:40:40.954
That's funny.

1678
02:40:46.028 --> 02:40:47.489
You're being serious?

1679
02:40:51.579 --> 02:40:53.863
It's time for me to be
who I am rather than

1680
02:40:54.448 --> 02:40:56.707
who I'm supposed to be.

1681
02:40:58.139 --> 02:41:02.046
But you, you're a leader.
That's who you are.

1682
02:41:04.701 --> 02:41:06.983
You know I'd make a lot
of changes around here.

1683
02:41:07.008 --> 02:41:10.190
I'm counting on it.
Your Majesty.

1684
02:41:20.255 --> 02:41:21.592
What will you do?

1685
02:41:21.975 --> 02:41:23.194
I'm not sure.

1686
02:41:23.836 --> 02:41:26.290
For the first time in a
thousand years, I...

1687
02:41:26.462 --> 02:41:29.112
I have no path. I do
have a ride, though.

1688
02:41:29.206 --> 02:41:31.434
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

1689
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:36.921
Well, here we are.

1690
02:41:37.392 --> 02:41:39.580
Tree! Good to see you.

1691
02:41:41.816 --> 02:41:42.816
Well...

1692
02:41:43.675 --> 02:41:46.507
The As-Guardians of the
Galaxy back together again.

1693
02:41:47.550 --> 02:41:49.056
Where to first?

1694
02:41:52.096 --> 02:41:55.332
Just so you know, this is my ship still.
I'm in charge.

1695
02:41:55.675 --> 02:41:58.232
I know. I know. Of
course, you are.

1696
02:41:58.498 --> 02:41:59.710
Of course.

1697
02:42:02.282 --> 02:42:05.299
See, you say of course, but
then you touch the map.

1698
02:42:05.324 --> 02:42:08.208
It makes you think that maybe you
didn't realize I was in charge.

1699
02:42:08.310 --> 02:42:11.555
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there. Okay?

1700
02:42:11.571 --> 02:42:13.766
I'm merely trying to be of service.
An assistant.

1701
02:42:13.791 --> 02:42:16.108
- Quill.
- That's what I said.

1702
02:42:16.133 --> 02:42:18.399
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

1703
02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:19.970
Sounds fair.

1704
02:42:22.567 --> 02:42:24.255
- It's not necessary.
- It's not.

1705
02:42:24.271 --> 02:42:24.880
Okay?

1706
02:42:24.905 --> 02:42:27.547
I got some blasters unless
you guys wanna use knives.

1707
02:42:27.577 --> 02:42:30.071
Oh, yes. Please, use knives.

1708
02:42:30.954 --> 02:42:32.212
I am Groot.

1709
02:42:38.984 --> 02:42:39.985
Not necessary.

1710
02:42:40.032 --> 02:42:41.930
There shall be no
knifing one another.

1711
02:42:41.955 --> 02:42:44.566
Everybody knows who's in charge.

1712
02:42:48.232 --> 02:42:49.366
It's me.

1713
02:42:52.758 --> 02:42:55.659
Yes, you! Of course!

1714
02:42:56.026 --> 02:42:58.528
Of course. Of course.

1715
02:43:00.936 --> 02:43:02.022
Remember...

1716
02:43:03.404 --> 02:43:05.765
You have to return the stones at
the exact moment you got them.

1717
02:43:05.789 --> 02:43:09.455
Or you're gonna open up a bunch
of nasty alternative realities.

1718
02:43:09.517 --> 02:43:11.620
Don't worry, Bruce.
Clip all the branches.

1719
02:43:12.989 --> 02:43:14.474
You know, I tried.

1720
02:43:16.132 --> 02:43:19.852
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.

1721
02:43:23.711 --> 02:43:26.955
- I miss them, man.
- Me, too.

1722
02:43:30.535 --> 02:43:33.506
You know, if you want,
I can come with you.

1723
02:43:35.791 --> 02:43:37.534
You're a good man, Sam.

1724
02:43:37.657 --> 02:43:39.704
This one's on me, though.

1725
02:43:43.622 --> 02:43:46.139
Don't do anything stupid
'till I get back.

1726
02:43:47.575 --> 02:43:50.772
How can I? You're taking
all the stupid with you.

1727
02:43:58.278 --> 02:43:59.809
Gonna miss you, Buddy.

1728
02:44:00.043 --> 02:44:01.904
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

1729
02:44:09.171 --> 02:44:11.265
How long is this gonna take?

1730
02:44:11.391 --> 02:44:14.188
For him? As long as he
needs, For us, five seconds.

1731
02:44:19.292 --> 02:44:20.543
Ready, Cap?

1732
02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:23.435
Alright. We'll meet
you back here, okay?

1733
02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:24.849
You bet.

1734
02:44:25.913 --> 02:44:30.799
Going quantum. Three..
two.. one...

1735
02:44:32.543 --> 02:44:39.523
And returning in, five,
four, three, two, one...

1736
02:44:46.884 --> 02:44:48.135
Where is he?

1737
02:44:48.182 --> 02:44:51.480
I don't know. He blew right by his
time stamp. He should be here.

1738
02:44:57.083 --> 02:44:58.448
- Well, get him back.
- I'm trying.

1739
02:44:58.473 --> 02:45:00.959
- Get him the hell back.
- I said, I'm trying!

1740
02:45:01.029 --> 02:45:02.115
Sam.

1741
02:45:25.321 --> 02:45:26.499
Go ahead.

1742
02:45:44.946 --> 02:45:45.947
Cap?

1743
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:49.308
Hi, Sam.

1744
02:45:52.766 --> 02:45:55.713
So did something go wrong,
or did something go right?

1745
02:45:57.761 --> 02:46:01.389
Well, after I put the
stones back, I thought...

1746
02:46:02.890 --> 02:46:06.830
Maybe I'll try some
of that life Tony was...

1747
02:46:07.526 --> 02:46:09.386
telling me to get.

1748
02:46:11.506 --> 02:46:13.678
How did that work out for you?

1749
02:46:16.063 --> 02:46:17.454
It was beautiful.

1750
02:46:18.978 --> 02:46:21.494
I'm happy for you. Truly.

1751
02:46:22.458 --> 02:46:23.583
Thank you.

1752
02:46:25.124 --> 02:46:27.257
Only thing bumming me
out is the fact I have

1753
02:46:27.282 --> 02:46:29.767
to live in a world
without Captain America.

1754
02:46:30.705 --> 02:46:31.706
Oh...

1755
02:46:33.911 --> 02:46:35.223
That reminds me...

1756
02:46:45.099 --> 02:46:46.295
Try it on.

1757
02:47:11.808 --> 02:47:13.199
How's it feel?

1758
02:47:15.677 --> 02:47:17.678
Like it's someone else's.

1759
02:47:20.610 --> 02:47:21.776
It isn't.

1760
02:47:35.122 --> 02:47:36.333
Thank you.

1761
02:47:38.498 --> 02:47:39.944
I'll do my best.

1762
02:47:45.259 --> 02:47:46.855
That's why it's yours.

1763
02:47:48.904 --> 02:47:50.772
You wanna tell me about her?

1764
02:47:56.694 --> 02:47:57.695
No.

1765
02:47:58.694 --> 02:48:00.422
No, I don't think I will.
