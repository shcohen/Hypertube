3
00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.033
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:32.331
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:34.511
How about now?
Can you see now?

6
00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:38.144
All right.

7
00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:40.933
Ready? Three fingers.

8
00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:42.317
Nice!

9
00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:46.727
- Nice throw, kiddo!
- Go.

10
00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:50.664
Hey, you guys want mayo
or mustard, or both?

11
00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:53.187
Who wants mayo on a hotdog?

12
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.609
Pardon your brothers. Two mustards, please!
Thanks, momma.

13
00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.828
Got it.

14
00:00:57.914 --> 00:01:00.187
Nate, mayo or mustard?

15
00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:02.218
I want ketchup.

16
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.137
Mind your elbow...

17
00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.267
Good job, Hawkeye!
Go get your arrow.

18
00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.242
Hey, guys. Enough practice.
Soup's on.

19
00:01:17.914 --> 00:01:20.734
All right. We're coming.
We're hungry.

20
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.296
Lila, let's go.

21
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.393
Lila?

22
00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.173
Honey?

23
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.365
Babe?

24
00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:46.907
Babe?

25
00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:49.892
Babe?

26
00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:53.142
Boys!

27
00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.399
Boys?

28
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.611
Laura!

29
00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:45.266
You don't need to do that,

30
00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.743
because you're just
holding the position.

31
00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:50.165
Come on.

32
00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:51.710
That was close.

33
00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:55.092
That's a goal. We're
now one a-piece.

34
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:56.817
I would like to try again.

35
00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:00.168
We're tied up.

36
00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:02.364
Feel the tension? It's fun.

37
00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:06.145
That was terrible. Now you
have a chance to win.

38
00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.395
And you won. Congratulations.

39
00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:11.145
Fair game.

40
00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.356
Good sport.

41
00:03:14.682 --> 00:03:15.966
You had fun?

42
00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:19.142
It was fun.

43
00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.633
This thing on?

44
00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:48.274
Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.

45
00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:52.063
If you find this recording...

46
00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:56.672
don't post it, on social media.
It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.

47
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:59.727
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

48
00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:02.135
I don't even know
if you're still...

49
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.297
Oh, God. I hope so...

50
00:04:05.302 --> 00:04:09.617
Today is day 21... uh, 22.

51
00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:13.411
You know, if it wasn't for
the existensial terror of

52
00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:15.575
staring into the
literal void of space,

53
00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.762
I'd say, I'm feeling
more better today.

54
00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:22.007
The infection's run its course,
thanks to the blue meanie back there.

55
00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:24.921
You'd love her. Very practical.

56
00:04:25.312 --> 00:04:27.342
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

57
00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:36.268
Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but
we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge

58
00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:39.149
to buy ourselves, about,
48 hours of playtime.

59
00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:44.713
But it's now dead in the water.

60
00:04:44.738 --> 00:04:47.738
We're 1,000 lightyears
from the nearest 7-11.

61
00:04:49.763 --> 00:04:52.254
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning.

62
00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.005
That'll be it.

63
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.030
And Pep, I...

64
00:05:00.055 --> 00:05:02.468
I know I said no
more surprises, but

65
00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:05.727
I gotta say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.

66
00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:07.085
But it looks like...

67
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.118
Well, you know what
it looks like.

68
00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:12.960
Don't feel bad about this.

69
00:05:12.985 --> 00:05:16.070
I mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks,

70
00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:19.378
and then, move on
with enormous guilt.

71
00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:28.230
I should probably lie down.
I'm gonna caress my

72
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:33.856
Please know that...

73
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:37.201
When I drift off, it will be

74
00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:41.608
goodbye the whole time...

75
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.562
I'll think about you.

76
00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:46.373
Because it's always you.

77
00:09:09.497 --> 00:09:11.997
- Couldn't stop him.
- Neither could I.

78
00:09:15.457 --> 00:09:16.722
I lost the kid.

79
00:09:19.457 --> 00:09:21.392
Tony, we lost.

80
00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:25.136
Is, umm...

81
00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:27.347
Oh, my God!

82
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.684
It's okay.

83
00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:45.131
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.

84
00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:49.817
World governments are in pieces.

85
00:09:49.842 --> 00:09:53.467
The parts that are still working
are trying to take a census,

86
00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:55.388
And it looks like he did...

87
00:09:58.427 --> 00:10:01.981
He did exactly what he said he
was gonna do. Thanos wiped out..

88
00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:06.567
...fifty percent of
all living creatures.

89
00:10:11.034 --> 00:10:12.729
Where is he now? Where?

90
00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:14.612
We don't know.

91
00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:18.064
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

92
00:10:20.682 --> 00:10:22.149
What's wrong with him?

93
00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:24.104
He's pissed.

94
00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:26.741
He thinks he failed.

95
00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:30.989
Which of course he did, but there's a
lot of that goin' around, ain't there?

96
00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:34.369
Honestly, at this exact second, I
thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

97
00:10:34.394 --> 00:10:35.357
Maybe I am.

98
00:10:35.382 --> 00:10:37.319
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

99
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.043
Deep space scans, and
satellites, and we got nothing.

100
00:10:43.218 --> 00:10:45.686
- Tony you fought him.
- Who told you that?

101
00:10:45.826 --> 00:10:46.826
Didn't fight him.

102
00:10:46.904 --> 00:10:49.145
No. He wiped my face
with a planet while a

103
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.514
Bleecker Street magician
gave away the stone.

104
00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:53.381
- That's what happened. There was no fight...
- Okay.

105
00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:54.155

106
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.867
Did he give you any clues?
Any coordinates, anything?

107
00:10:57.805 --> 00:10:58.805
Pfft!

108
00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:03.086
I saw this coming a few years back. I had
a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

109
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.100
Thought I was dreaming.

110
00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:07.967
- Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.
- And I needed you.

111
00:11:08.265 --> 00:11:12.381
As in past tense. That trumps what
you need. It's too late, buddy.

112
00:11:12.749 --> 00:11:13.749
Sorry.

113
00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:17.467
You know what I need?
I need to shave.

114
00:11:18.273 --> 00:11:21.764
- And I believe I rememeber telling
- Tony, Tony, Tony...

115
00:11:21.827 --> 00:11:23.711
why that otherwise,

116
00:11:23.736 --> 00:11:28.190
that what we needed was a suit of armor
around the world. Remember that?

117
00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:32.660
Whether it impacted our precious
freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.

118
00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:35.224
- Well that didn't work out, did it?
- I said we'd lose.

119
00:11:35.337 --> 00:11:38.212
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."

120
00:11:38.268 --> 00:11:40.899
Well guess what, Cap? We lost.

121
00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:43.338
You weren't there.

122
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.750
But that's what we do, right?
Our best work after the fact?

123
00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:50.016
We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?

124
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.736
Okay. You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

125
00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:55.408
- No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.
- Tony, sit, sit down!

126
00:11:55.456 --> 00:11:57.862
We need you. You're new blood.
Bunch of tired old mills...

127
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.380
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,

128
00:12:01.405 --> 00:12:04.314
no clues, no strategies,
no options...

129
00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:08.295
Zero. Zip. Nada. No
trust, you liar...

130
00:12:12.655 --> 00:12:15.662
Here, take this. You find
him and you put that on.

131
00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:17.804
You hide.

132
00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:22.344
- Tony!
- I'm fine. I...

133
00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:33.455
Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna
probably be out for the rest of the day.

134
00:12:33.783 --> 00:12:37.174
You guys take care of him. And I'll bring
an Bezurian elixir when I come back.

135
00:12:37.822 --> 00:12:40.298
- Where are you going?
- To kill Thanos.

136
00:12:43.642 --> 00:12:44.282
Hey.

137
00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:47.025
You know we usually work
as a team here, and

138
00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:49.024
between you and I we're
also a little fragile.

139
00:12:49.064 --> 00:12:52.649
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight, too.

140
00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:55.196
- You even know where he is?
- I know people who might.

141
00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:56.992
Don't bother.

142
00:12:57.578 --> 00:12:59.913
I can tell you where Thanos is.

143
00:13:02.086 --> 00:13:04.828
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

144
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:09.326
Then when he worked, he
talked about his great plan.

145
00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:12.303
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.

146
00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:17.053
I'd ask, where would we go
once his plan was complete?

147
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.237
His answer was always the same.

148
00:13:24.406 --> 00:13:25.531
To The Garden.

149
00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:28.820
That's cute. Thanos has
a retirement plan.

150
00:13:28.845 --> 00:13:30.493
So where is he, then?

151
00:13:30.556 --> 00:13:32.304
When Thanos snapped his fingers,

152
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:36.860
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

153
00:13:36.907 --> 00:13:41.188
No one's ever seen anything like it...
until two days ago.

154
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.617
On this planet.

155
00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:46.289
Thanos is there.

156
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.601
He used the stones again.

157
00:13:49.937 --> 00:13:51.004
Hey, hey, hey...

158
00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:54.057
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?

159
00:13:54.082 --> 00:13:56.535
- Look, he still got the stones, so...
- So let's get him.

160
00:13:57.012 --> 00:13:59.706
- We use them to bring everyone back.
- Just like that?

161
00:13:59.868 --> 00:14:01.696
Yeah. Just like that.

162
00:14:01.721 --> 00:14:04.876
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

163
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:07.657
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

164
00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:11.924
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

165
00:14:11.969 --> 00:14:14.109
Because before, you
didn't have me.

166
00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:18.655
Hey, new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.

167
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.612
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?

168
00:14:21.637 --> 00:14:24.183
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

169
00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:27.028
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.

170
00:14:46.483 --> 00:14:47.764
I like this one.

171
00:14:53.107 --> 00:14:55.724
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.

172
00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:21.173
Okay. Who here hasn't
been to space?

173
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:25.797
You better not throw
up on my ship.

174
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.391
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.

175
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.231
I'll head down for recon.

176
00:16:03.133 --> 00:16:05.976
- This is gonna work Steve.
- I know it will.

177
00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:12.584
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

178
00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:18.427
No satellites, no ships, no armies,
no ground defenses of any kind.

179
00:16:19.989 --> 00:16:21.301
It's just him.

180
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:24.059
Then that's enough.

181
00:17:53.483 --> 00:17:54.756
Oh, no.

182
00:18:04.589 --> 00:18:05.924
Where are they?

183
00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:08.604
Answer the question.

184
00:18:10.104 --> 00:18:12.908
The universe
required correction.

185
00:18:13.003 --> 00:18:18.272
After that, the stones served
no purpose, beyond temptation.

186
00:18:18.343 --> 00:18:20.116
You murdered trillions!

187
00:18:21.388 --> 00:18:23.075
You should be grateful.

188
00:18:26.974 --> 00:18:30.028
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

189
00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:34.111
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

190
00:18:34.189 --> 00:18:37.314
I used the stones to
destroy the stones.

191
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.798
It nearly killed me.

192
00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:45.126
But the work is done.
It always will be.

193
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:51.050
I am inevitable.

194
00:18:53.097 --> 00:18:55.636
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.

195
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.326
My father is many things.

196
00:18:57.761 --> 00:19:00.323
A liar is not one of them.

197
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.324
Thank you, Daughter.

198
00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:10.465
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

199
00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:19.809
What... what did you do?

200
00:19:21.582 --> 00:19:23.621
I went for the head.

201
00:20:34.296 --> 00:20:35.616
So I, uh...

202
00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:39.436
Went on a date the other day.

203
00:20:40.378 --> 00:20:44.379
It's the first time in five years,
you know? Sit there, dinner...

204
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:47.262
I didn't know what
to talk about.

205
00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:50.785
What did you talk about?

206
00:20:50.826 --> 00:20:54.060
Same old crap, you know? How
things have changed, and...

207
00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:56.356
My job, his job....

208
00:20:56.841 --> 00:20:59.301
How much we miss the Mets.

209
00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:03.272
Then things get quiet..

210
00:21:05.216 --> 00:21:08.528
He cried as they were
serving the salads.

211
00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:10.481
What about you?

212
00:21:11.825 --> 00:21:14.817
I cried just before dessert.

213
00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:21.403
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

214
00:21:21.403 --> 00:21:22.621
That's great.

215
00:21:22.653 --> 00:21:24.606
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump, you

216
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:26.723
didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

217
00:21:27.207 --> 00:21:31.674
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps you gotta take.

218
00:21:31.684 --> 00:21:35.269
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.

219
00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.871
I went in the ice in '45 right
after I met the love of my life.

220
00:21:42.308 --> 00:21:44.230
Woke up 70 years later.

221
00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:48.269
You got to move on.

222
00:21:51.785 --> 00:21:53.090
Got to move on.

223
00:21:58.388 --> 00:22:00.341
The world is in our hands.

224
00:22:00.661 --> 00:22:02.614
It's left to us guys.

225
00:22:02.778 --> 00:22:05.403
And we got to do
something with it.

226
00:22:06.052 --> 00:22:07.371
Otherwise...

227
00:22:08.642 --> 00:22:11.329
Thanos should've
killed all of us.

228
00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:14.680
What the hell?

229
00:23:26.487 --> 00:23:27.534
Hope?

230
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.426
Kid! Hey, kid!

231
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.882
What the hell happened here?

232
00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:42.845
My God...

233
00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:50.571
No. Please. Please, please.
No, no, no...

234
00:24:56.617 --> 00:24:59.304
Excuse me. Sorry.
No, Cassie, no.

235
00:24:59.858 --> 00:25:00.858
No.

236
00:25:01.882 --> 00:25:02.882
No, no.

237
00:25:04.615 --> 00:25:06.529
Please, please,
please, please....

238
00:25:06.554 --> 00:25:07.554
No, Cassie...

239
00:25:14.796 --> 00:25:15.796
What?

240
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:47.198
Cassie?

241
00:25:48.495 --> 00:25:49.495
Dad?

242
00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:17.348
You're so big!

243
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:35.912
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.

244
00:26:35.937 --> 00:26:37.991
It was an infectious
garbage scowl.

245
00:26:38.016 --> 00:26:39.522
So, thanks for the hot tip.

246
00:26:39.656 --> 00:26:42.381
- Well, you were closer.
- Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

247
00:26:42.406 --> 00:26:44.278
You get a reading
on those tremors?

248
00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:46.795
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.

249
00:26:46.914 --> 00:26:49.328
Do we have a visual? How
are we handling it?

250
00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:52.593
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.

251
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:55.592
We handle it by not handling it.

252
00:26:56.374 --> 00:26:58.772
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

253
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:01.850
- Not likely.
- What, you gonna get another haircut?

254
00:27:01.895 --> 00:27:05.511
Listen, fur-face. I'm
covering a lot of territory.

255
00:27:05.536 --> 00:27:07.411
The things that are
happening on Earth are

256
00:27:07.436 --> 00:27:10.302
happening everywhere, on
thousands of planets.

257
00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.998
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

258
00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.351
So you might not see
me for a long time.

259
00:27:16.572 --> 00:27:18.513
All right. Uh, well...

260
00:27:19.153 --> 00:27:23.457
This channel is always active.
So, anything goes sideways...

261
00:27:23.528 --> 00:27:25.949
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

262
00:27:26.215 --> 00:27:29.097
- Comes through me.
- Okay.

263
00:27:29.113 --> 00:27:30.113
All right.

264
00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:32.535
Good luck.

265
00:27:40.874 --> 00:27:43.218
- Where are you?
- Mexico.

266
00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:46.226
The federales found a
room full of bodies.

267
00:27:46.468 --> 00:27:50.053
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never
even had the chance to get their guns off.

268
00:27:50.124 --> 00:27:53.491
- It's probably a rival gang...
- Except it isn't.

269
00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:55.896
It's definitely Barton.

270
00:27:56.039 --> 00:28:00.406
What he's done here, what he's
been doing for the last few years,

271
00:28:01.998 --> 00:28:04.060
I mean, the scene
that he left...

272
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.935
I gotta tell you, there's a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.

273
00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:16.102
Will you find out where
he's going next?

274
00:28:20.064 --> 00:28:21.064
Nat...

275
00:28:22.624 --> 00:28:23.829
Please.

276
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.460
Okay.

277
00:28:36.273 --> 00:28:40.343
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already.

278
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.499
You here to do your laundry?

279
00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:47.445
And to see a friend.

280
00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:50.266
Clearly, your friend is fine.

281
00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:56.222
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.

282
00:28:56.247 --> 00:28:59.364
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

283
00:28:59.372 --> 00:29:03.426
You know, if you're about to tell
me to look on the bright side...

284
00:29:03.971 --> 00:29:04.971
Um...

285
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.838
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

286
00:29:11.737 --> 00:29:14.572
Sorry. Force of habit.

287
00:29:28.425 --> 00:29:32.635
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and... grow.

288
00:29:34.783 --> 00:29:35.915
Some do.

289
00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:40.657
But not us.

290
00:29:41.523 --> 00:29:45.843
- If I move on, who does this?
- Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

291
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.445
I used to have nothing.

292
00:29:53.594 --> 00:29:55.672
And then I got this.

293
00:29:57.969 --> 00:29:59.258
This job.

294
00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:03.414
This family.

295
00:30:07.596 --> 00:30:11.275
And I was... I was
better because of it.

296
00:30:17.784 --> 00:30:19.096
And even though...

297
00:30:20.161 --> 00:30:21.629
they're gone...

298
00:30:25.278 --> 00:30:27.559
Now, I'm still
trying to be better.

299
00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:32.921
I think we both
need to get a life.

300
00:30:35.766 --> 00:30:37.007
You first.

301
00:30:42.195 --> 00:30:43.616
Oh... Hi. Hi!

302
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.582
Is anyone home?
This is Scott Lang.

303
00:30:46.607 --> 00:30:51.255
We met a few years ago, at the airport?
In Germany?

304
00:30:51.287 --> 00:30:54.146
I got really big and
I had my mask on.

305
00:30:54.171 --> 00:30:56.091
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

306
00:30:56.116 --> 00:30:59.046
Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I
know you know that.

307
00:30:59.132 --> 00:31:00.155
It's the front gate.

308
00:31:00.186 --> 00:31:01.986
I need to talk to you guys.

309
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:08.850
Scott.

310
00:31:10.193 --> 00:31:12.200
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

311
00:31:13.864 --> 00:31:16.419
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?

312
00:31:16.748 --> 00:31:18.864
Only in mid-conversation.

313
00:31:19.052 --> 00:31:20.052
Alright. So...

314
00:31:21.155 --> 00:31:25.810
Five years ago, right before...
Thanos,

315
00:31:25.913 --> 00:31:28.147
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

316
00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:31.186
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.

317
00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:34.750
To get in there, you have to be
incredibly small. Hope, she's my...

318
00:31:36.586 --> 00:31:38.102
She... she was my...

319
00:31:40.141 --> 00:31:43.843
She was supposed to pull me out.
And then Thanos happened, and

320
00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:47.539
- I got stuck in there.
- Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.

321
00:31:47.564 --> 00:31:50.235
Yeah, but that's just it.
It wasn't.

322
00:31:50.243 --> 00:31:51.977
For me it was five hours.

323
00:31:52.002 --> 00:31:54.565
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

324
00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:59.040
Everything is unpredictable. Is that
anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.

325
00:31:59.353 --> 00:32:00.353
Scott.

326
00:32:00.439 --> 00:32:02.329
What are you talking about?

327
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:03.421
So...

328
00:32:04.538 --> 00:32:06.319
What I'm saying is...

329
00:32:07.036 --> 00:32:09.387
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

330
00:32:09.475 --> 00:32:11.653
The only problem is right now, we
don't have a way to navigate it.

331
00:32:11.694 --> 00:32:13.037
But what if we did?

332
00:32:13.085 --> 00:32:16.810
I can't stop thinking about it. What
if we could somehow control the chaos,

333
00:32:16.835 --> 00:32:20.317
and we could navigate it? What if
there was a way that we can enter

334
00:32:20.342 --> 00:32:22.787
the quantum realm at a certain
point in time but then

335
00:32:22.812 --> 00:32:25.912
exit the quantum realm at
another point in time? Like...

336
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:28.792
Like before Thanos.

337
00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:31.281
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?

338
00:32:31.306 --> 00:32:34.426
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

339
00:32:34.575 --> 00:32:36.630
It's more like a...

340
00:32:37.862 --> 00:32:41.369
Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy.
It's crazy.

341
00:32:41.932 --> 00:32:45.299
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...

342
00:32:45.674 --> 00:32:48.513
Some wa... It's crazy.

343
00:32:48.538 --> 00:32:52.483
I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,
nothing sounds crazy anymore.

344
00:32:53.288 --> 00:32:55.366
So who do we talk to about this?

345
00:33:13.418 --> 00:33:14.418
Chow-time!

346
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880
Morgoona.

347
00:33:22.372 --> 00:33:24.583
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?

348
00:33:24.763 --> 00:33:27.661
- Define lunch or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

349
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:30.019
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

350
00:33:30.044 --> 00:33:32.925
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.

351
00:33:36.316 --> 00:33:38.518
There you go. Are you
thinking about lunch?

352
00:33:39.034 --> 00:33:41.190
Want a handful of crickets?

353
00:33:41.253 --> 00:33:43.095
- No.
- That's what you want.

354
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.534
- How did you find this?
- Garage.

355
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.343
Really?

356
00:33:47.367 --> 00:33:49.726
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

357
00:33:50.249 --> 00:33:51.920
I found it, though.

358
00:33:52.209 --> 00:33:55.435
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.

359
00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:59.415
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.

360
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.193
Now, we know what
it sounds like...

361
00:34:23.266 --> 00:34:25.218
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...

362
00:34:25.242 --> 00:34:27.631
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,

363
00:34:27.656 --> 00:34:30.664
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?

364
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:31.820
Thank you.

365
00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:34.515
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

366
00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.540
- I did.
- No.

367
00:34:35.578 --> 00:34:37.574
You accidentally survived. It's a---

368
00:34:37.621 --> 00:34:40.129
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

369
00:34:40.197 --> 00:34:41.964
And now you wanna pull a...

370
00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:43.587
What do you call it?

371
00:34:45.305 --> 00:34:48.015
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.

372
00:34:48.289 --> 00:34:50.456
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?

373
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:52.972
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?

374
00:34:52.997 --> 00:34:56.442
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.

375
00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:58.973
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

376
00:34:58.998 --> 00:35:01.139
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

377
00:35:01.179 --> 00:35:02.404
I don't believe we would.

378
00:35:02.529 --> 00:35:05.841
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.

379
00:35:06.121 --> 00:35:09.136
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,

380
00:35:09.161 --> 00:35:13.457
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.

381
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.577
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

382
00:35:16.602 --> 00:35:19.609
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

383
00:35:19.836 --> 00:35:23.781
That means no talking to our past selves,
no betting on sporting events...

384
00:35:23.813 --> 00:35:26.343
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

385
00:35:26.899 --> 00:35:28.968
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to

386
00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:32.093
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?

387
00:35:34.036 --> 00:35:36.114
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.

388
00:35:36.136 --> 00:35:39.409
'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's
not how quantum physics works.

389
00:35:39.662 --> 00:35:40.662
Tony...

390
00:35:42.662 --> 00:35:44.552
We have to take a stand.

391
00:35:44.951 --> 00:35:47.701
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.

392
00:35:49.138 --> 00:35:52.904
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.

393
00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.990
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.

394
00:35:58.083 --> 00:36:02.464
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.

395
00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:04.090
And you're telling me
that you won't even...

396
00:36:04.115 --> 00:36:06.122
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.

397
00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:09.348
Got a kid.

398
00:36:11.192 --> 00:36:13.442
Mommy told me to
come and save you.

399
00:36:13.467 --> 00:36:16.113
Good job. I'm saved.

400
00:36:16.706 --> 00:36:18.855
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.

401
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:21.784
Anything else. Honestly, I
missed you guys, it was...

402
00:36:21.863 --> 00:36:24.972
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.

403
00:36:25.089 --> 00:36:27.479
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

404
00:36:28.097 --> 00:36:30.057
But this is a second chance.

405
00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:32.792
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

406
00:36:32.891 --> 00:36:35.008
I can't roll the dice again.

407
00:36:36.497 --> 00:36:39.200
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

408
00:36:41.951 --> 00:36:44.522
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.

409
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.966
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?

410
00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:49.231
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?

411
00:36:49.256 --> 00:36:51.162
No. I wanna do it right.

412
00:36:54.433 --> 00:36:56.613
We're gonna need a
really big brain.

413
00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:58.690
Bigger than his?

414
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:01.869
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating. Try some of that.

415
00:37:01.894 --> 00:37:03.127
Have some eggs.

416
00:37:03.393 --> 00:37:04.674
I'm so confused.

417
00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:07.350
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...

418
00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:10.256
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.

419
00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:13.687
I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.

420
00:37:13.812 --> 00:37:18.082
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?

421
00:37:18.222 --> 00:37:20.770
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.

422
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:24.146
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.

423
00:37:24.389 --> 00:37:28.488
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.

424
00:37:28.513 --> 00:37:31.357
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.

425
00:37:32.923 --> 00:37:34.791
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's

426
00:37:34.816 --> 00:37:37.252
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.

427
00:37:38.026 --> 00:37:40.908
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.

428
00:37:40.975 --> 00:37:46.029
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.

429
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.943
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.

430
00:37:50.149 --> 00:37:52.227
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?

431
00:37:52.252 --> 00:37:55.861
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.

432
00:37:55.909 --> 00:37:58.705
Come on, step on up. You mind?

433
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:59.730
Oh.

434
00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:03.036
- Say "green."
- Green.

435
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:04.715
Greeeen.

436
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.443
- Did you get that?
- That's good.

437
00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:10.779
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

438
00:38:13.552 --> 00:38:15.206
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

439
00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:17.417
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...

440
00:38:17.442 --> 00:38:19.964
You want to take a
picture with him, right?

441
00:38:19.989 --> 00:38:22.106
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.

442
00:38:22.131 --> 00:38:25.090
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.

443
00:38:25.092 --> 00:38:26.998
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

444
00:38:27.029 --> 00:38:29.373
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.

445
00:38:29.398 --> 00:38:31.904
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the goddamn phone.

446
00:38:33.021 --> 00:38:33.954
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

447
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:36.256
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.

448
00:38:36.569 --> 00:38:38.725
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.

449
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.951
- Dab.
- Bruce.

450
00:38:40.976 --> 00:38:43.679
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.

451
00:38:43.704 --> 00:38:46.671
- About we were saying...
- Right.

452
00:38:48.582 --> 00:38:51.285
The whole time travel do-over?

453
00:38:52.698 --> 00:38:55.878
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

454
00:38:56.957 --> 00:38:58.839
Well, you pulled this off.

455
00:38:59.191 --> 00:39:02.644
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

456
00:39:36.149 --> 00:39:38.852
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.

457
00:39:39.138 --> 00:39:43.005
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.

458
00:39:43.029 --> 00:39:47.630
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?

459
00:39:47.655 --> 00:39:49.287
Processing...

460
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:56.784
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.

461
00:39:56.809 --> 00:39:59.505
- Gotta take a second.
- Just a moment.

462
00:39:59.926 --> 00:40:03.152
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

463
00:40:04.315 --> 00:40:06.424
Model rendered.

464
00:40:17.669 --> 00:40:18.669
Shit!

465
00:40:19.019 --> 00:40:20.019
Shit!

466
00:40:24.234 --> 00:40:26.140
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?

467
00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:27.999
- Shit.
- No. We don't say that.

468
00:40:28.039 --> 00:40:31.265
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.

469
00:40:31.273 --> 00:40:32.314
Why you up?

470
00:40:32.339 --> 00:40:34.964
'Cause I got some important shit
going on here. What do you think?

471
00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:38.126
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

472
00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:42.136
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.

473
00:40:43.873 --> 00:40:46.013
That's extortion.

474
00:40:47.029 --> 00:40:50.880
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...

475
00:40:52.404 --> 00:40:53.755
my mind.

476
00:40:54.576 --> 00:40:57.747
You done? Yeah? Now you are.

477
00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:06.184
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.

478
00:41:06.451 --> 00:41:08.052
A story.

479
00:41:08.326 --> 00:41:10.857
Once upon a time, a little
girl went to bed. The end.

480
00:41:10.896 --> 00:41:12.226
That ain't the whole story.

481
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:14.501
Come on, that's your
favorite story.

482
00:41:14.585 --> 00:41:16.053
I love you tons.

483
00:41:17.773 --> 00:41:20.295
I love you 3,000.

484
00:41:21.202 --> 00:41:22.202
Wow.

485
00:41:29.338 --> 00:41:32.361
3,000. That's crazy.

486
00:41:33.198 --> 00:41:35.731
Go to bed. Or I'll
sell all your toys.

487
00:41:36.065 --> 00:41:37.260
Night-night.

488
00:41:38.033 --> 00:41:41.705
Not that it's a competition,
but she loves me 3,000.

489
00:41:42.502 --> 00:41:46.400
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

490
00:41:52.037 --> 00:41:56.076
- What you reading?
- Just a book on composting.

491
00:41:56.101 --> 00:41:58.318
What's new with composting?

492
00:41:59.584 --> 00:42:01.217
- Just ....
- I figured it out...

493
00:42:02.225 --> 00:42:03.693
by the way.

494
00:42:04.903 --> 00:42:07.473
You know, just so we're talking
about the same thing...

495
00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:09.301
Time travel.

496
00:42:10.434 --> 00:42:11.434
What?

497
00:42:14.896 --> 00:42:15.896
Wow.

498
00:42:18.193 --> 00:42:19.193
That's...

499
00:42:19.966 --> 00:42:23.693
Amazing, and.... terrifying.

500
00:42:23.756 --> 00:42:24.935
That's right.

501
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.836
- I got really lucky.
- Yeah. I know.

502
00:42:36.906 --> 00:42:40.031
- A lot of people didn't.
- No, I can't help everybody.

503
00:42:41.316 --> 00:42:44.269
- It sorta seems like you can.
- Not if I stop.

504
00:42:45.816 --> 00:42:49.011
I can put a pin in it
right now, and stop.

505
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.636
Tony...

506
00:42:51.121 --> 00:42:56.253
trying to get you to stop has been one
of the few failures of my entire life.

507
00:43:00.123 --> 00:43:05.740
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked
box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...

508
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:08.333
...go to bed.

509
00:43:14.062 --> 00:43:16.570
But would you be able to rest?

510
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:24.154
Okay, here we go. Time
travel test number one.

511
00:43:24.374 --> 00:43:29.069
Scott, fire up the, uhh...
The van thing.

512
00:43:30.977 --> 00:43:34.470
Breakers are set. Emergency
generators are on standby.

513
00:43:34.501 --> 00:43:39.345
Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't
wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.

514
00:43:39.439 --> 00:43:41.759
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

515
00:43:42.024 --> 00:43:43.843
You can't say things like that.

516
00:43:43.868 --> 00:43:46.969
Just... it was, just a bad joke.

517
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:50.594
- You were kidding, right?
- I have no idea.

518
00:43:50.671 --> 00:43:54.811
We're talking about time travel here.
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

519
00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:57.982
We're good! Get your helmet on.

520
00:43:58.693 --> 00:44:01.419
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week, but you'll walk

521
00:44:01.444 --> 00:44:04.443
around for an hour, then bring
you back in 10 seconds.

522
00:44:04.623 --> 00:44:07.069
- Makes sense?
- Perfectly not confusing.

523
00:44:07.094 --> 00:44:09.695
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

524
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.447
You're right. I do,
Captain America.

525
00:44:16.103 --> 00:44:21.946
On the count of three.
3.. 2.. 1..

526
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:28.982
Guys? This doesn't feel right.

527
00:44:29.122 --> 00:44:30.990
- What's going on? Hold on.
- Who is that?

528
00:44:31.015 --> 00:44:33.022
- Is that Scott?
- Yes, it's Scott!

529
00:44:36.096 --> 00:44:37.807
Ooh! My back!

530
00:44:40.373 --> 00:44:42.815
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it!

531
00:44:49.752 --> 00:44:50.752
A baby.

532
00:44:50.777 --> 00:44:52.362
- It's Scott.
- As a baby!

533
00:44:53.032 --> 00:44:54.088
Bring Scott back.

534
00:44:54.113 --> 00:44:56.408
When I say kill the
power, kill the power.

535
00:44:57.619 --> 00:44:59.689
And... kill it!

536
00:45:03.138 --> 00:45:05.528
Somebody peed my pants.

537
00:45:06.786 --> 00:45:09.793
I don't know if it was
"baby" me or "old" me.

538
00:45:13.155 --> 00:45:15.163
Or, just "me" me.

539
00:45:15.218 --> 00:45:17.046
Time travel!

540
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:21.570
What?

541
00:45:22.913 --> 00:45:25.709
I see this as an absolute win.

542
00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:12.112
Why the long face?

543
00:46:12.175 --> 00:46:14.104
Let me guess. He
turned into a baby.

544
00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.317
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

545
00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.340
That's the EPR paradox.

546
00:46:19.536 --> 00:46:23.185
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you
might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

547
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:26.161
It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody
coulda cautioned you against it.

548
00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:28.592
- You did.
- Oh, did I?

549
00:46:29.315 --> 00:46:33.893
Thank God, I'm here.
Regardless, I fixed it.

550
00:46:33.918 --> 00:46:36.338
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

551
00:46:38.359 --> 00:46:40.425
I just want peace.

552
00:46:40.968 --> 00:46:44.257
Turns out, resentment is
corrosive, and I hate it.

553
00:46:44.771 --> 00:46:46.091
Me, too.

554
00:46:47.356 --> 00:46:49.189
We got a shot at getting
these stones, but I

555
00:46:49.214 --> 00:46:50.965
gotta tell you my
priority is to bring back

556
00:46:50.995 --> 00:46:53.384
what we lost? I hope, yes.

557
00:46:53.409 --> 00:46:56.276
Keep what I found? I
have to, at all costs.

558
00:46:57.503 --> 00:47:01.346
And, maybe not die
trying will be nice.

559
00:47:03.737 --> 00:47:05.635
Sounds like a deal.

560
00:47:28.683 --> 00:47:32.729
- Tony, I don't know...
- Why? He made it for you.

561
00:47:33.378 --> 00:47:37.784
Plus, honestly I have to get it out the
garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

562
00:47:42.516 --> 00:47:43.891
Thank you, Tony.

563
00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:48.781
Will you keep that a little quietly?
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

564
00:47:49.904 --> 00:47:55.380
- We are getting, the whole team, yeah?
- We're working on that right now.

565
00:48:13.478 --> 00:48:18.986
- Hey, humie! Where's big green?
- Kitchen. I think.

566
00:48:20.284 --> 00:48:24.549
- That's awesome.
- Rodent, careful on re-entry.

567
00:48:24.565 --> 00:48:27.166
There's an idiot on
the landing zone.

568
00:48:27.687 --> 00:48:28.687
Oh, God!

569
00:48:29.585 --> 00:48:32.069
What's up, regular-sized man?

570
00:49:22.411 --> 00:49:26.848
Kind of a step down from a golden palace
for an Avenger highness or whatnot.

571
00:49:26.873 --> 00:49:29.364
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.
First, they've lost Asgard,

572
00:49:29.389 --> 00:49:32.280
then half the people. They're probably
just happy they have a home.

573
00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:34.422
You shouldn't have come!

574
00:49:35.914 --> 00:49:36.914
Valkyrie!

575
00:49:37.456 --> 00:49:39.791
Great to see you, Angry Girl.

576
00:49:40.088 --> 00:49:43.220
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

577
00:49:43.665 --> 00:49:45.844
- This is Rocket.
- How you doin'?

578
00:49:47.907 --> 00:49:50.032
- He won't see you.
- That bad, huh?

579
00:49:50.432 --> 00:49:52.721
We only see him once a month,
when he comes in for...

580
00:49:53.971 --> 00:49:55.361
...supplies.

581
00:49:55.915 --> 00:49:57.915
- It's that bad.
- Yeah.

582
00:50:10.612 --> 00:50:11.737
What the...

583
00:50:14.286 --> 00:50:17.348
Woo! Something died in here.

584
00:50:17.989 --> 00:50:20.207
Hello? Thor?

585
00:50:20.676 --> 00:50:22.808
Are you here about the cable?

586
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:28.637
The Cinemax ran out two weeks ago,
and, sports were all kind of fuzzy...

587
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:41.131
Boys! Oh, my God!

588
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.967
My God! How have you been?

589
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.170
Come here, you little rascal!

590
00:50:47.654 --> 00:50:49.193
No, I'm good! I'm good.

591
00:50:49.568 --> 00:50:51.326
That's not necessary!

592
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.182
Hulk, you know my friends,
Miek, Korg, right?

593
00:50:54.214 --> 00:50:56.577
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys. Long time no see.

594
00:50:56.602 --> 00:50:59.471
Beer's on the bucket. Feel
free to log on to the wi-fi.

595
00:50:59.496 --> 00:51:01.205
No password, obviously.

596
00:51:02.148 --> 00:51:06.210
Thor, he's back. That kid on the TV
who's called me a dickhead again.

597
00:51:07.046 --> 00:51:10.273
- Noobmaster.
- Yeah, Noobmaster69.

598
00:51:12.906 --> 00:51:15.906
Noobmaster. Hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder?

599
00:51:15.937 --> 00:51:18.976
Listen, buddy. If you don't log off
this game immediately I'm gonna fly

600
00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:21.820
home to your house, come down to
that basement you're hiding in,

601
00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:24.281
rip off your arms then
shove them up your butt!

602
00:51:24.697 --> 00:51:27.791
Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to
your father, you little weasel!

603
00:51:28.095 --> 00:51:29.244
Thank you, Thor.

604
00:51:29.269 --> 00:51:30.855
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

605
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.376
Thank you very much. I will.

606
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:34.602
So you guys want a drink?
What are you drinking?

607
00:51:34.627 --> 00:51:37.095
We have beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

608
00:51:40.134 --> 00:51:42.689
Buddy, you all right?

609
00:51:42.736 --> 00:51:45.548
Yes, I'm fine! Why,
don't I look all right?

610
00:51:45.673 --> 00:51:47.720
You look like melted ice cream.

611
00:51:49.143 --> 00:51:51.588
So, what's up?

612
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.064
We need your help. There might be
a chance we could fix everything.

613
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.869
What, like the cable? 'Cause that's
been driving me bananas for weeks.

614
00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.307
Like Thanos.

615
00:52:20.017 --> 00:52:23.073
Don't say that name.

616
00:52:23.618 --> 00:52:26.681
Um, yeah. We don't actually
say that name in here.

617
00:52:31.498 --> 00:52:33.521
Please take your hand off me.

618
00:52:36.467 --> 00:52:37.467
Now, I know that...

619
00:52:38.981 --> 00:52:41.824
guy might scare you.

620
00:52:42.083 --> 00:52:46.364
Why would I be? Why would, why
would I be scared of that guy?

621
00:52:46.951 --> 00:52:49.279
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

622
00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.458
Anyone else here
killed that guy?

623
00:52:55.399 --> 00:52:58.492
Nope. Didn't think so.

624
00:52:59.102 --> 00:53:03.227
Korg, why don't you, tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off.

625
00:53:03.252 --> 00:53:05.016
Umm... Stormbreaker?

626
00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:07.563
Now, who's swinging
Stormbreaker?

627
00:53:10.735 --> 00:53:14.307
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?
I've been there myself.

628
00:53:14.315 --> 00:53:16.557
You wanna know who
helped me out of it?

629
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:19.533
I don't know. Is it... Natasha?

630
00:53:19.557 --> 00:53:20.721
It was you.

631
00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:23.283
You helped me.

632
00:53:24.939 --> 00:53:29.603
Why don't you ask the,
Asgardians down there,

633
00:53:29.627 --> 00:53:32.158
how much my help was worth.

634
00:53:37.038 --> 00:53:39.003
The ones that are left, anyway.

635
00:53:39.252 --> 00:53:41.034
I think we can bring them back.

636
00:53:41.526 --> 00:53:44.752
Stop. Just, stop...

637
00:53:45.677 --> 00:53:50.700
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in
my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and

638
00:53:50.725 --> 00:53:53.539
and saved. But I'm fine, okay?
We're fine, aren't we?

639
00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:54.812
Nah, all good here, mate!

640
00:53:54.837 --> 00:53:56.695
So, whatever it is that
you're offering, we're

641
00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.070
not into it, don't care,
couldn't care less.

642
00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:00.226
Goodbye.

643
00:54:03.608 --> 00:54:04.882
We need you, pal.

644
00:54:14.664 --> 00:54:16.649
There's beer on the ship.

645
00:54:20.877 --> 00:54:22.010
What kind?

646
00:54:34.685 --> 00:54:37.035
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

647
00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:09.668
We never did anything to you!

648
00:55:22.096 --> 00:55:24.543
You're done hurting people.

649
00:55:30.687 --> 00:55:31.866
You're crazy!

650
00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:02.847
Wait! Help me!

651
00:56:08.527 --> 00:56:09.996
What I want...

652
00:56:10.717 --> 00:56:12.161
You can't give me.

653
00:56:35.673 --> 00:56:37.352
You shouldn't be here.

654
00:56:39.352 --> 00:56:40.907
Neither should you.

655
00:56:46.955 --> 00:56:48.603
I've got a job to do.

656
00:56:50.204 --> 00:56:52.282
Is that what you're
calling this?

657
00:56:52.892 --> 00:56:56.094
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

658
00:57:01.209 --> 00:57:02.802
We found something.

659
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:06.130
A chance, maybe...

660
00:57:09.538 --> 00:57:10.623
Don't.

661
00:57:11.788 --> 00:57:13.155
Don't what?

662
00:57:15.858 --> 00:57:17.655
Don't give me hope.

663
00:57:20.972 --> 00:57:23.636
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

664
00:57:45.077 --> 00:57:48.702
Drifting left. On the
side there, Lebowski.

665
00:57:51.828 --> 00:57:54.017
- Ratchet, how's it going?
- It's Rocket.

666
00:57:54.042 --> 00:57:57.135
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

667
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:58.190
Yup.

668
00:58:01.691 --> 00:58:04.206
Time travel suit? Not bad.

669
00:58:04.634 --> 00:58:06.275
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!

670
00:58:06.306 --> 00:58:09.063
- I'm being very careful.
- No, you're being very Hulky.

671
00:58:09.072 --> 00:58:11.647
- I'm being careful.
- These are Pym particles, all right?

672
00:58:11.672 --> 00:58:14.423
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

673
00:58:14.448 --> 00:58:16.501
This is what we have. We're
not making any more.

674
00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:18.271
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

675
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.675
We've got enough for
one round trip, each.

676
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:24.653
That's it. No do-overs.
Plus, two test runs.

677
00:58:29.206 --> 00:58:30.487
One test run.

678
00:58:31.284 --> 00:58:33.081
All right. I'm not
ready for this.

679
00:58:33.106 --> 00:58:34.190
I'm game.

680
00:58:36.745 --> 00:58:37.831
I'll do it.

681
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:41.151
Clint, now you're gonna feel
a little discombobulated

682
00:58:41.176 --> 00:58:42.909
from the chronoshift.
Don't worry about it.

683
00:58:42.917 --> 00:58:44.243
Wait a second, let me
ask you something.

684
00:58:44.268 --> 00:58:47.088
If we can do this, you know, go
back in time, why don't we just

685
00:58:47.113 --> 00:58:50.299
find baby Thanos, you know?
And...

686
00:58:53.605 --> 00:58:55.846
- First of all, that's horrible.
- It's Thanos.

687
00:58:55.871 --> 00:59:00.410
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

688
00:59:00.435 --> 00:59:03.302
Look, we go back, we get the
stones before Thanos gets them...

689
00:59:03.327 --> 00:59:06.225
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

690
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.107
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

691
00:59:08.132 --> 00:59:10.544
- Well, that's what I heard.
- What? By who? Who told you that?

692
00:59:10.577 --> 00:59:13.389
Star Trek, Terminator,
TimeCop, Time After Time,

693
00:59:13.414 --> 00:59:14.739
- Quantum Leap.
- A Wrinkle in Time,

694
00:59:14.764 --> 00:59:17.262
- Somewhere in Time,
- Hot Tub Time Machine.

695
00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:21.544
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically,
any movie that deals with time travel.

696
00:59:21.569 --> 00:59:23.413
Die Hard? No, it's not...

697
00:59:23.437 --> 00:59:24.476
This is known.

698
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:26.843
I don't know why everyone believes
that, but that isn't true.

699
00:59:26.897 --> 00:59:31.186
Think about it: If you travel to the
past, that past becomes your future.

700
00:59:31.335 --> 00:59:34.556
And your former present
becomes the past.

701
00:59:34.642 --> 00:59:37.462
Which can't now be changed
by your new future...

702
00:59:37.506 --> 00:59:38.587
Exactly.

703
00:59:38.906 --> 00:59:41.562
So Back to the Future's
a bunch of bullshit?

704
00:59:46.384 --> 00:59:52.477
All right, Clint. We're going in 3..
2.. 1...

705
01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:06.043
Cooper?

706
01:01:06.247 --> 01:01:09.083
- Where are my headphones?
- Lila?

707
01:01:14.387 --> 01:01:15.997
Lila! No!

708
01:01:21.232 --> 01:01:22.232
Dad?

709
01:01:26.138 --> 01:01:27.216
Dad?

710
01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.243
Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?

711
01:01:41.095 --> 01:01:42.095
Yeah.

712
01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:46.290
It worked.

713
01:01:47.942 --> 01:01:49.106
It worked.

714
01:01:52.489 --> 01:01:54.410
Okay, so the "how" works.

715
01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:58.208
Now we gotta figure out the
"when," and the "where."

716
01:01:59.134 --> 01:02:00.868
Almost everyone in this
room has had an encounter

717
01:02:00.893 --> 01:02:02.719
with at least one of the
six Infinity Stones.

718
01:02:02.759 --> 01:02:04.523
Well, I'd subtitute the
word 'encounter' for 'damn

719
01:02:04.548 --> 01:02:07.009
near been killed by one of
the six Infinity Stones.'

720
01:02:07.204 --> 01:02:10.625
I haven't. I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.

721
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:15.742
Regardless, we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round trip each,

722
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:19.148
and these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

723
01:02:19.173 --> 01:02:23.343
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

724
01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:27.093
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

725
01:02:27.187 --> 01:02:30.358
So. Let's start
with the Aether.

726
01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:32.459
Thor, what do you know?

727
01:02:37.436 --> 01:02:38.654
Is he asleep?

728
01:02:44.171 --> 01:02:46.506
Where to start? Umm...

729
01:02:47.648 --> 01:02:50.483
The Aether, first,
is not a stone.

730
01:02:50.663 --> 01:02:54.054
Someone's called it a stone before.
Ahem...

731
01:02:54.116 --> 01:02:57.819
It's more of a... an angry
sludge, sort of thing. So...

732
01:02:57.844 --> 01:03:00.984
Someone's gonna need to amend
that, and stop saying that.

733
01:03:01.191 --> 01:03:03.124
Here's an interesting
story, though.

734
01:03:03.205 --> 01:03:05.653
About the Aether. My
grandafther, many years

735
01:03:05.678 --> 01:03:09.681
ago, had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

736
01:03:11.707 --> 01:03:13.488
Scary beings. So Jane...

737
01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:20.628
Oh, there she is. That's Jane...
She's... an old flame of mine.

738
01:03:21.228 --> 01:03:24.634
She... she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

739
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:27.993
and then the Aether stuck
itself inside her.

740
01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:31.217
And, she became very, very sick.
So I had to take her to

741
01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:34.976
Asgard, which is where I'm from.
And we had to try and fix her.

742
01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:40.648
We were dating at the time, you see. I
got to introduce her to my Mother...

743
01:03:42.064 --> 01:03:44.299
who's dead, and umm....

744
01:03:45.311 --> 01:03:49.108
Oh, you know. Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...

745
01:03:49.443 --> 01:03:51.982
These things happen though, you know.
Nothing lasts forever.

746
01:03:52.007 --> 01:03:53.239
- The only thing that...
- Why don't you come sit down.

747
01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:57.663
I'm not done yet. The only thing that
is permanent in life, is impermanence.

748
01:03:58.421 --> 01:03:59.529
Awesome.

749
01:03:59.554 --> 01:04:00.725
Eggs? Breakfast?

750
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.688
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

751
01:04:02.747 --> 01:04:05.600
Quill said he stole the
Power Stone from Morag.

752
01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:09.155
- Is that a person?
- Morag's a planet.

753
01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:11.129
Quill was a person.

754
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:14.300
Like a planet? Like
in outer space?

755
01:04:14.425 --> 01:04:18.230
Oh, look. It's like a little
puppy, all happy and everything.

756
01:04:18.362 --> 01:04:21.885
Do you wanna go to space? You
wanna go to space, puppy?

757
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.133
I'll take you to space.

758
01:04:24.423 --> 01:04:28.055
- Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
- What is Vormir?

759
01:04:28.626 --> 01:04:33.118
A dominion of death, at the very
center of Celestial existence.

760
01:04:34.511 --> 01:04:38.300
It's where... Thanos
murdered my sister.

761
01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:45.712
Noted.

762
01:04:47.571 --> 01:04:49.672
- That Time Stone guy...
- Doctor Strange.

763
01:04:49.712 --> 01:04:51.258
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

764
01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:54.922
- Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat.
- Nice place in the village, though.

765
01:04:54.954 --> 01:04:57.405
- Yeah. Sullivan Street.
- Hmm... Bleecker.

766
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:59.039
Wait, he lived in New York?

767
01:04:59.304 --> 01:05:02.280
- No. He lived in Toronto.
- Yeah, not Bleecker. It's Sullivan.

768
01:05:02.652 --> 01:05:07.534
Guys, if you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

769
01:05:09.816 --> 01:05:11.253
Shut the front door!

770
01:05:14.199 --> 01:05:16.737
All right. We have a plan.

771
01:05:16.815 --> 01:05:21.447
Six stones, three
teams, one shot.

772
01:05:30.773 --> 01:05:32.875
Five years ago, we lost.

773
01:05:33.883 --> 01:05:35.062
All of us.

774
01:05:37.149 --> 01:05:38.196
We lost friends...

775
01:05:39.593 --> 01:05:40.687
We lost family...

776
01:05:43.067 --> 01:05:44.879
We lost a part of ourselves.

777
01:05:46.106 --> 01:05:48.567
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

778
01:05:49.784 --> 01:05:52.963
You know your teams, you
know your missions.

779
01:05:53.377 --> 01:05:56.205
Get the stones, get them back.

780
01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:00.620
One round trip each. No mistakes.
No do-overs.

781
01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:03.258
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

782
01:06:03.312 --> 01:06:05.999
But it doesn't mean we
should know what to expect.

783
01:06:06.218 --> 01:06:09.421
Be careful. Look out
for each other.

784
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.648
This is the fight of our lives.
And we're gonna win.

785
01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.375
Whatever it takes.

786
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:22.367
Good luck.

787
01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.836
- He's pretty good at that.
- Right?

788
01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:27.851
All right. You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, jelly green.

789
01:06:28.561 --> 01:06:30.670
Tractors engaged.

790
01:06:31.047 --> 01:06:33.084
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

791
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:35.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay.

792
01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:38.883
- I'll do my best.
- As promises go, that was pretty lame.

793
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.922
See you in a minute.

794
01:07:37.039 --> 01:07:40.453
All right, we all have our assignments.
Two stones uptown, one stone, down.

795
01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:43.257
Stay low. Keep an
eye on the clock.

796
01:07:58.089 --> 01:08:00.424
Feel free to smash if
things don't go your way.

797
01:08:01.214 --> 01:08:03.393
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

798
01:08:30.825 --> 01:08:34.278
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

799
01:08:38.793 --> 01:08:41.433
Ma'am, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

800
01:08:42.722 --> 01:08:45.644
You're about... five
years too early.

801
01:08:46.034 --> 01:08:50.370
Stephen Strange is currently performing
surgery about twenty blocks that way.

802
01:08:51.671 --> 01:08:53.440
What do you want from him?

803
01:08:53.811 --> 01:08:55.342
That, actually.

804
01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.631
Ah.

805
01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:01.139
- I'm afraid not.
- Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

806
01:09:01.663 --> 01:09:03.591
- You don't wanna do this.
- You're right. I don't.

807
01:09:03.616 --> 01:09:06.850
But I need that stone, and
I don't have time to...

808
01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:16.848
Let's start over, shall we?

809
01:09:36.148 --> 01:09:37.304
That's Jane.

810
01:09:38.945 --> 01:09:40.023
All right.

811
01:09:41.623 --> 01:09:43.201
Here's the deal, Tubby:

812
01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:45.299
You're gonna charm her and I'm
gonna poke her with this thing

813
01:09:45.324 --> 01:09:48.553
and extract the Reality Stone
and get gone, lickety-split.

814
01:09:49.601 --> 01:09:52.905
I'll be right back, okay? There's a
wine cellar, that's just down there.

815
01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:55.726
My father used to fish
with a barrel of ale.

816
01:09:55.781 --> 01:09:59.984
- I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...
- Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

817
01:10:18.787 --> 01:10:20.677
Who's the fancy broad?

818
01:10:21.538 --> 01:10:25.202
It's my Mother.
She dies today.

819
01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:28.154
Oh. That's today?

820
01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:37.352
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

821
01:10:37.377 --> 01:10:40.711
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.
This was a bad idea.

822
01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:43.055
- Come here.
- No, no, no. I think I'm having...

823
01:10:43.094 --> 01:10:46.539
- I'm having a panic attack.
- Come here. Right here.

824
01:10:47.071 --> 01:10:50.953
You think you're the only one who lost
people? What do you think we're doing here?

825
01:10:50.978 --> 01:10:53.148
I lost the only
family I ever had.

826
01:10:53.173 --> 01:10:57.352
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick
with the antenna, all gone.

827
01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:02.399
Now, I get you miss your Mom.
But she's gone. Really gone.

828
01:11:02.712 --> 01:11:05.540
And there are plenty of people
who are only kinda gone.

829
01:11:05.579 --> 01:11:07.392
But you can help them.

830
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:11.199
So is it too much to ask that you
brush the crumbs outta your beard,

831
01:11:11.224 --> 01:11:15.177
make schmoopy talk to Pretty
Pants, and when she's not looking,

832
01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:19.310
suck out the Infinity Stone and
help me get my family back?

833
01:11:20.245 --> 01:11:21.245
Okay.

834
01:11:21.713 --> 01:11:24.432
- Are you crying?
- No...

835
01:11:26.577 --> 01:11:27.577
Yes!

836
01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:30.264
Get it together!
You can do this.

837
01:11:30.858 --> 01:11:32.514
You can do this.

838
01:11:35.585 --> 01:11:36.764
All right?

839
01:11:37.093 --> 01:11:39.280
- Yes, I can.
- Good.

840
01:11:41.085 --> 01:11:43.506
I can do this.

841
01:11:44.506 --> 01:11:45.748
I can't do this.

842
01:11:45.928 --> 01:11:49.513
Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone.
This is our shot.

843
01:11:49.568 --> 01:11:50.568
Thor?

844
01:11:51.201 --> 01:11:52.201
Thor!

845
01:12:02.503 --> 01:12:04.159
Alright. Bring it down low.

846
01:12:04.184 --> 01:12:06.727
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

847
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:12.573
Hey, can we hurry it up?

848
01:12:12.598 --> 01:12:14.804
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

849
01:12:14.949 --> 01:12:17.811
All that, is really helpful.

850
01:12:19.075 --> 01:12:20.769
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

851
01:12:20.889 --> 01:12:23.387
Take that stone and come back.
No messing around.

852
01:12:23.636 --> 01:12:25.448
- Hey.
- You got this.

853
01:12:25.545 --> 01:12:26.794
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

854
01:12:26.854 --> 01:12:28.466
See you back.

855
01:12:28.981 --> 01:12:30.904
You guys watch each other's six.

856
01:12:30.912 --> 01:12:31.912
Yeah.

857
01:12:40.826 --> 01:12:43.240
The coordinates for
Vormir are laid in.

858
01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.534
All they have to do
is not fall out.

859
01:12:51.938 --> 01:12:54.570
We're a long way from Budapest.

860
01:12:58.857 --> 01:13:00.239
Okay, so, uhh...

861
01:13:01.925 --> 01:13:04.869
We just wait around for this
Quill guy to show up and

862
01:13:04.894 --> 01:13:07.566
then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

863
01:13:08.027 --> 01:13:09.652
Let's take cover.

864
01:13:10.605 --> 01:13:13.636
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

865
01:13:13.761 --> 01:13:15.175
Wait a minute, what are
you talking about right

866
01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.143
now? Who else is looking
for these stones?

867
01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:22.742
My father, my sister...

868
01:13:23.722 --> 01:13:26.206
- and me.
- And you?

869
01:13:27.884 --> 01:13:29.844
Where are you right now?

870
01:13:58.404 --> 01:14:01.670
- You're welcome.
- I didn't ask for your help.

871
01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:05.005
And yet, you always need it.

872
01:14:08.108 --> 01:14:09.225
Get up.

873
01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.670
- Father wants us back on the ship.
- Why?

874
01:14:11.725 --> 01:14:14.209
He's found an Infinity Stone.

875
01:14:17.913 --> 01:14:21.647
- Where?
- On a planet called Morag.

876
01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:25.299
Father's plan is
finally in motion.

877
01:14:25.324 --> 01:14:28.683
- One stone isn't six, Nebula.
- It's a start.

878
01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:31.351
If he gets all of them...

879
01:14:43.292 --> 01:14:47.011
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

880
01:14:47.036 --> 01:14:50.394
- He won't like that.
- His alternative is death, then.

881
01:14:52.099 --> 01:14:56.989
Ronan's obsession
clouds his judgement.

882
01:15:01.262 --> 01:15:03.333
We will not fail you, Father.

883
01:15:04.435 --> 01:15:06.263
No, you won't.

884
01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:10.124
I swear...

885
01:15:11.618 --> 01:15:13.796
I will make you proud.

886
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:25.095
We just, wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,

887
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.714
and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

888
01:15:28.098 --> 01:15:29.574
Let's take cover.

889
01:15:30.472 --> 01:15:34.011
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

890
01:15:35.886 --> 01:15:38.081
- Who was that?
- I don't know...

891
01:15:38.143 --> 01:15:41.221
My head is splitting...
I don't know...

892
01:15:42.408 --> 01:15:45.741
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

893
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:57.368
Bring her to my ship.

894
01:16:05.348 --> 01:16:07.903
Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.

895
01:16:07.928 --> 01:16:10.513
Got it. I'm approaching
the elevator now.

896
01:16:16.432 --> 01:16:18.432
If it's all the same to you...

897
01:16:20.572 --> 01:16:22.239
I'll have that drink now.

898
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:26.931
All right. Good one. No standing around,
I'm closing up this door for later.

899
01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:28.915
By the way, feel
free to clean up.

900
01:16:28.962 --> 01:16:31.571
Ugh, Mr. Rogers. I almost
forgot that that suit

901
01:16:31.617 --> 01:16:35.055
- did nothing for your ass.
- No one asked you to look.

902
01:16:35.114 --> 01:16:37.121
I think you look great, Cap.

903
01:16:37.146 --> 01:16:40.837
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

904
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:44.056
- Uhh, magic wand?
- STRIKE team's coming to secure it.

905
01:16:54.199 --> 01:16:56.112
We can take that
off your hands.

906
01:16:56.214 --> 01:16:57.440
By all means.

907
01:16:59.262 --> 01:17:02.855
- Careful with that thing!
- Unless you want your mind erased.

908
01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.051
- Not in a fun way.
- We promise to be careful.

909
01:17:05.086 --> 01:17:07.906
- Who are these guys?
- They are SHIELD...

910
01:17:07.945 --> 01:17:10.804
Well, actually Hydra. But,
we didn't know that yet.

911
01:17:10.854 --> 01:17:14.838
Seriously, you didn't? I mean...
they look like bad guys.

912
01:17:14.885 --> 01:17:16.738
You're small, but
you're talking loud.

913
01:17:16.763 --> 01:17:18.376
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.

914
01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.527
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue!

915
01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:23.322
I mean, honestly! How do
you think you'll be...

916
01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:24.567
Shut up.

917
01:17:25.997 --> 01:17:28.903
All right, you're up, little buddy.
There's our stone.

918
01:17:29.075 --> 01:17:31.567
Alright. Flick me.

919
01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.302
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
- Hey! Buddy.

920
01:17:48.337 --> 01:17:50.734
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

921
01:17:50.759 --> 01:17:53.594
- Take the stairs!
- Yeah. Stop. Stop!

922
01:17:56.387 --> 01:17:59.496
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs!

923
01:18:02.832 --> 01:18:07.597
All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the
elevator just passing the 80th floor.

924
01:18:08.199 --> 01:18:09.215
On it.

925
01:18:09.902 --> 01:18:12.386
- Head to the lobby.
- Alright. I'll see you there.

926
01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:15.386
Evidence secure. We're
en route to Dr. List.

927
01:18:15.949 --> 01:18:19.316
No. No hitches at all, Mr.
Secretary.

928
01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.457
Captain. I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue?

929
01:18:27.543 --> 01:18:29.191
Change of plans.

930
01:18:32.705 --> 01:18:33.792
Hey, Cap.

931
01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.378
Rumlow.

932
01:18:42.913 --> 01:18:46.944
I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm
gonna be running point on the scepter.

933
01:18:49.115 --> 01:18:51.864
Sir? I don't understand.

934
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:55.928
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

935
01:18:55.953 --> 01:18:57.202
Sorry, Cap.

936
01:18:57.631 --> 01:18:59.519
I can't give you the scepter.

937
01:18:59.653 --> 01:19:03.988
- I'm gonna have to call the Director.
- That's okay. Trust me.

938
01:19:07.503 --> 01:19:09.049
Hail Hydra.

939
01:19:23.031 --> 01:19:25.125
So many stairs!

940
01:19:36.623 --> 01:19:39.404
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

941
01:19:39.428 --> 01:19:41.920
- It is go-time.
- Bombs away.

942
01:19:49.246 --> 01:19:51.363
Is, is that Axe body spray?

943
01:19:51.388 --> 01:19:54.161
Yeah, I had a can just
for emergencies. Relax.

944
01:19:54.231 --> 01:19:58.301
- Can we focus, please?
- I'm going inside you. Now.

945
01:20:03.651 --> 01:20:05.396
May I ask you
where you're going?

946
01:20:05.421 --> 01:20:07.926
To lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?

947
01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:11.584
Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one
of the folks behind Nick Fury.

948
01:20:11.609 --> 01:20:13.075
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

949
01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:15.577
I'm gonna have to ask you to
turn that prisoner over to me.

950
01:20:15.648 --> 01:20:18.702
- Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
- Oh, he's gonna answer to us.

951
01:20:18.727 --> 01:20:21.452
Odin can have what's left. And
I'm gonna need that case.

952
01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.609
That's been SHIELD property
for over 70 years.

953
01:20:23.634 --> 01:20:24.851
Hand over the case, Stark.

954
01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:27.517
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things
are getting dicey up here. Let's go.

955
01:20:27.542 --> 01:20:29.709
I'm not gonna argue who's got the
higher authority here, all right?

956
01:20:29.734 --> 01:20:31.125
You promise me you won't die?

957
01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:34.131
You're only giving me a
mild cardiac dysrythmia.

958
01:20:34.186 --> 01:20:35.889
That doesn't sound mild.

959
01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:36.533
I need the case.

960
01:20:36.558 --> 01:20:38.391
I know you got a lotta pull.
I'm just saying...

961
01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:40.205
Okay. Then give me the case.

962
01:20:42.127 --> 01:20:43.127
Do it, Lang!

963
01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:45.877
- Get your hands off!
- Window's closing. Pull my pin!

964
01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.158
Here goes!

965
01:20:50.416 --> 01:20:52.291
- Stark?
- Stark!

966
01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:54.337
Look, he's convulsing.
Give him air!

967
01:20:54.362 --> 01:20:56.369
- Medic!
- Medic!

968
01:20:56.627 --> 01:20:58.611
You got some help!

969
01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:02.439
Stark, you--- your
chest machine?

970
01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.470
Breathe! Breathe!

971
01:21:10.754 --> 01:21:13.699
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

972
01:21:19.136 --> 01:21:21.230
No stairs!

973
01:21:28.782 --> 01:21:30.291
You'll be fine, Stark.
Stay with us!

974
01:21:30.322 --> 01:21:33.353
I'll try something, okay? I have
no idea if it's gonna work.

975
01:21:34.915 --> 01:21:35.587
Yes!

976
01:21:35.612 --> 01:21:37.869
That worked a treat.
That was so crazy!

977
01:21:37.885 --> 01:21:39.900
I had no idea if
that was gonna work.

978
01:21:39.925 --> 01:21:41.766
- The case...
- The case. It's, uhh...

979
01:21:41.807 --> 01:21:44.275
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

980
01:21:44.548 --> 01:21:45.548
Loki!

981
01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:48.689
- That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
- Oh, we blew it.

982
01:21:48.736 --> 01:21:50.142
Loki!?

983
01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.915
Tony, what's going on?

984
01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.548
Tell me you found that cube.

985
01:21:58.447 --> 01:22:00.509
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

986
01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:06.752
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

987
01:22:06.862 --> 01:22:08.174
I'm not Loki.

988
01:22:11.543 --> 01:22:13.527
And I don't wanna hurt you.

989
01:22:22.355 --> 01:22:23.636
I can do this all day.

990
01:22:23.661 --> 01:22:26.043
Yeah, I know. I know.

991
01:22:58.548 --> 01:23:00.407
Where did you get this?

992
01:23:10.934 --> 01:23:14.500
Bucky... is... alive!

993
01:23:17.343 --> 01:23:18.343
What?

994
01:23:33.339 --> 01:23:35.432
That is America's ass.

995
01:23:39.456 --> 01:23:42.362
- Please, please!
- I'm sorry. I can't help you, Bruce.

996
01:23:43.261 --> 01:23:46.885
If I give up the Time Stone to help
your reality, I'm dooming my own.

997
01:23:46.933 --> 01:23:51.784
With all due respect, I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

998
01:23:57.405 --> 01:24:01.545
The Infinity Stones create what you
experience as the flow of time.

999
01:24:01.784 --> 01:24:05.503
Remove one of the stones,
and that flow splits.

1000
01:24:05.761 --> 01:24:10.823
Now this may benefit your reality.
But my new one, not so much.

1001
01:24:10.863 --> 01:24:16.105
In this new branched reality, without our
chief weapon against the forces of darkness,

1002
01:24:16.328 --> 01:24:20.203
our world will be overrun.
Millions will suffer.

1003
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.413
So, tell me, doctor, can your
science prevent all that?

1004
01:24:24.515 --> 01:24:27.811
No. But we can erase it.

1005
01:24:27.835 --> 01:24:31.741
Because once we're done with the stones, we
can return each one into its own timeline

1006
01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:36.124
at the moment it was taken.
So, chronologically...

1007
01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:42.319
In that reality....
it never left.

1008
01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:47.869
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1009
01:24:51.314 --> 01:24:54.149
In order to return the
stones, you have to survive.

1010
01:24:54.196 --> 01:24:57.009
We will. I will. I promise.

1011
01:24:57.666 --> 01:25:00.417
I can't risk this
reality on a promise.

1012
01:25:00.753 --> 01:25:05.534
It's the duty, of the Sorcerer
Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

1013
01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:09.128
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1014
01:25:09.925 --> 01:25:12.143
- What did you say?
- Strange. He gave it away.

1015
01:25:12.182 --> 01:25:13.964
He gave it to Thanos.

1016
01:25:14.244 --> 01:25:16.135
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1017
01:25:19.888 --> 01:25:23.060
- Why?
- I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.

1018
01:25:33.513 --> 01:25:34.794
Or I did.

1019
01:25:54.921 --> 01:25:57.608
Strange was meant to
be the best of us.

1020
01:25:57.632 --> 01:26:00.499
So he must've done
it for a reason.

1021
01:26:00.896 --> 01:26:03.239
I fear you might be right.

1022
01:26:07.349 --> 01:26:08.583
Thank you.

1023
01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:16.667
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1024
01:26:18.605 --> 01:26:19.963
We all are.

1025
01:26:40.102 --> 01:26:41.673
Run diagnostics.

1026
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:44.337
Show me her memory file.

1027
01:26:46.071 --> 01:26:48.594
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1028
01:26:49.743 --> 01:26:52.024
It was a memory, but not hers.

1029
01:26:52.844 --> 01:26:55.953
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.

1030
01:26:56.289 --> 01:26:57.703
Another Nebula.

1031
01:26:59.844 --> 01:27:01.133
Impossible.

1032
01:27:01.586 --> 01:27:06.992
This duplicate carries a time stamp...
from nine years in the future.

1033
01:27:11.761 --> 01:27:13.815
Where is this other Nebula?

1034
01:27:14.714 --> 01:27:17.479
In our solar system.
On Morag.

1035
01:27:18.394 --> 01:27:21.933
- Can you access her?
- Yes. The two are linked.

1036
01:27:21.964 --> 01:27:26.378
Search the duplicate's
memories, for Infinity Stones.

1037
01:27:30.023 --> 01:27:33.172
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

1038
01:27:33.188 --> 01:27:37.195
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

1039
01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:40.031
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

1040
01:27:40.056 --> 01:27:41.391
Freeze image.

1041
01:27:43.079 --> 01:27:44.407
Terrans.

1042
01:27:45.164 --> 01:27:46.868
Avengers.

1043
01:27:47.954 --> 01:27:52.118
Unruly wretches. What's
that reflection?

1044
01:27:52.946 --> 01:27:55.501
Amplify this, Maw.

1045
01:27:57.493 --> 01:27:59.149
I don't understand.

1046
01:28:03.555 --> 01:28:08.039
- Two Nebulas.
- No. The same Nebula.

1047
01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:10.366
From two different times.

1048
01:28:11.389 --> 01:28:15.521
Set course for Morag. Scan
the duplicate's memories.

1049
01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:18.959
I want to see everything.

1050
01:28:28.672 --> 01:28:30.658
My ladies, I'll see you after.
Go on.

1051
01:28:46.498 --> 01:28:49.013
- What are you doing?
- Ahh!

1052
01:28:50.427 --> 01:28:53.068
You're better off leaving the
sneaking to your brother.

1053
01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.334
Yeah, I was simply just
going for a walk, and uh...

1054
01:28:55.358 --> 01:28:56.757
What are you wearing?

1055
01:28:56.782 --> 01:28:59.123
I always wear this. This
is one of my favorites.

1056
01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:04.650
What's wrong with your eye?

1057
01:29:04.675 --> 01:29:07.823
Oh, my eye. That's... you
remember the Battle of Haroquin?

1058
01:29:07.839 --> 01:29:11.026
When I got hit in the
face with a broadsword?

1059
01:29:14.626 --> 01:29:17.672
You're not the Thor I
know at all, are you?

1060
01:29:17.681 --> 01:29:19.399
Yes, I am.

1061
01:29:19.627 --> 01:29:22.431
The future hasn't been
kind to you, has it?

1062
01:29:22.595 --> 01:29:24.928
I didn't say I'm
from the future.

1063
01:29:25.007 --> 01:29:27.437
I was raised by witches, boy.

1064
01:29:28.343 --> 01:29:31.522
I see with more than
eyes, and you know that.

1065
01:29:32.982 --> 01:29:35.567
I am totally, totally
from the future!

1066
01:29:35.593 --> 01:29:36.633
Yes, you are.

1067
01:29:37.294 --> 01:29:40.099
- I really need to talk to you.
- We can talk.

1068
01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:06.016
His head was over there...

1069
01:30:06.728 --> 01:30:08.392
His body over there...

1070
01:30:10.244 --> 01:30:12.484
What was the point.
I was too late.

1071
01:30:13.539 --> 01:30:15.116
I was just standing there.

1072
01:30:16.437 --> 01:30:19.390
- Some idiot with an ax.
- You're no idiot.

1073
01:30:20.852 --> 01:30:25.359
You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1074
01:30:25.656 --> 01:30:28.219
- I guess, yeah.
- Idiot? No.

1075
01:30:28.336 --> 01:30:32.515
- A failure? Absolutely.
- That's a little bit harsh.

1076
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:35.265
You do know what
that makes you?

1077
01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:37.727
Just like everyone else.

1078
01:30:37.868 --> 01:30:40.907
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1079
01:30:41.266 --> 01:30:44.578
Everyone fails at who they
are supposed to be, Thor.

1080
01:30:45.254 --> 01:30:48.359
The measure of a
person, of a hero

1081
01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:51.802
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1082
01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.800
I really missed you, Mum.

1083
01:31:04.455 --> 01:31:06.415
Thor! I got it!

1084
01:31:06.969 --> 01:31:08.742
Get that rabbit!

1085
01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:14.899
- Ma, I have to tell you something.
- No, son. You don't.

1086
01:31:15.299 --> 01:31:18.126
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1087
01:31:18.158 --> 01:31:21.923
- But this is about your future.
- It's none of my business.

1088
01:31:25.244 --> 01:31:26.244
Hey.

1089
01:31:26.399 --> 01:31:27.930
You must be Mom.

1090
01:31:28.735 --> 01:31:30.679
I got the thing. Come
on, we got to move.

1091
01:31:30.704 --> 01:31:34.196
- I wish we had more time.
- This was a gift.

1092
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:36.976
And you're going to be the
man you're meant to be.

1093
01:31:38.023 --> 01:31:40.968
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

1094
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:45.741
And eat a salad.

1095
01:31:47.312 --> 01:31:49.155
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Goodbye.

1096
01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:51.952
- Three... two...
- No, wait!

1097
01:31:54.968 --> 01:31:56.100
Wh- what am I looking at?

1098
01:31:56.125 --> 01:31:58.444
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

1099
01:32:07.445 --> 01:32:08.945
I'm still worthy.

1100
01:32:10.336 --> 01:32:11.609
Oh, boy.

1101
01:32:13.187 --> 01:32:15.171
Goodbye, Mom.

1102
01:32:54.314 --> 01:32:55.806
So he's an idiot?

1103
01:33:07.196 --> 01:33:08.383
What's that?

1104
01:33:08.423 --> 01:33:10.039
The tool of a thief.

1105
01:33:18.133 --> 01:33:19.666
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

1106
01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:23.840
This is the part where spikes come out,
with skeletons on the end and everything...

1107
01:33:23.865 --> 01:33:24.778
What are you talking about?

1108
01:33:24.803 --> 01:33:27.429
When you break into a place called
the temple of the Power Stone,

1109
01:33:27.454 --> 01:33:31.266
There's gonna be a bunch of booby
traps--- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1110
01:34:04.413 --> 01:34:06.186
I wasn't always like this.

1111
01:34:07.089 --> 01:34:08.295
Me either.

1112
01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.827
But we work with
what we got, right?

1113
01:34:15.053 --> 01:34:16.155
Sync up.

1114
01:34:18.358 --> 01:34:20.772
Three.. two.. one...

1115
01:34:33.697 --> 01:34:35.173
You murdered trillions!

1116
01:34:35.198 --> 01:34:36.933
You should be grateful.

1117
01:34:38.597 --> 01:34:41.605
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

1118
01:34:41.995 --> 01:34:45.675
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

1119
01:34:45.765 --> 01:34:50.756
I used the stones to destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.

1120
01:34:50.913 --> 01:34:54.975
But the work is done.
It always will be.

1121
01:34:56.155 --> 01:34:59.936
I am inevitable.

1122
01:35:00.913 --> 01:35:06.780
- What did you do to them?
- Nothing. Yet.

1123
01:35:08.028 --> 01:35:11.910
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1124
01:35:12.385 --> 01:35:15.924
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1125
01:35:16.174 --> 01:35:17.728
The stones...

1126
01:35:18.673 --> 01:35:20.470
I found them all.

1127
01:35:22.156 --> 01:35:23.406
I won.

1128
01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:27.441
Tipped the cosmic
scales to balance.

1129
01:35:31.597 --> 01:35:33.003
This is your future.

1130
01:35:33.566 --> 01:35:35.050
It's my destiny.

1131
01:35:36.792 --> 01:35:40.768
My father is many things. A
liar is not one of them.

1132
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:45.795
Thank you, Daughter.

1133
01:35:46.154 --> 01:35:49.248
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

1134
01:35:53.251 --> 01:35:56.017
And that, is destiny fulfilled.

1135
01:35:56.728 --> 01:36:00.017
Sire, your Daughter...

1136
01:36:01.625 --> 01:36:02.625
No...

1137
01:36:03.078 --> 01:36:04.366
...is a traitor.

1138
01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:09.047
That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.

1139
01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.310
I know.

1140
01:36:18.137 --> 01:36:20.856
And you'll have the
chance to prove it.

1141
01:36:27.743 --> 01:36:28.743
No...

1142
01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:30.633
He knows!

1143
01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:37.671
Barton? Barton, come in.

1144
01:36:37.734 --> 01:36:41.960
Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem.
Come on!

1145
01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.742
Come in, we have a prob....

1146
01:36:43.969 --> 01:36:45.820
Thanos knows.

1147
01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:47.235
Thanos...

1148
01:37:01.277 --> 01:37:02.277
Cap...

1149
01:37:03.863 --> 01:37:05.929
Sorry, buddy.
We got a problem.

1150
01:37:05.972 --> 01:37:08.464
Huh. Yeah, we do.

1151
01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:11.011
- Well, what are we gonna do now?
- You know what, give me a break, Steve.

1152
01:37:11.036 --> 01:37:12.723
I just got hit in the
head with a Hulk.

1153
01:37:12.857 --> 01:37:15.801
You said that we had one shot.
This, this was our shot.

1154
01:37:15.826 --> 01:37:18.493
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.
Six stones or nothing.

1155
01:37:18.518 --> 01:37:20.603
You're repeating yourself, you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1156
01:37:20.628 --> 01:37:22.408
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1157
01:37:22.433 --> 01:37:23.316
- No!
- Come on.

1158
01:37:23.341 --> 01:37:25.637
You never wanted a time heist, you
went on board with the time heist...

1159
01:37:25.662 --> 01:37:27.028
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1160
01:37:27.053 --> 01:37:28.269
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah!

1161
01:37:28.294 --> 01:37:30.206
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1162
01:37:30.215 --> 01:37:31.949
No, no, no. There's
no other options.

1163
01:37:31.996 --> 01:37:34.121
There's no do-overs. We're
not going anywhere else.

1164
01:37:34.152 --> 01:37:36.596
We have one particle left. Each.

1165
01:37:36.621 --> 01:37:40.285
That's it, alright? We use that...
Bye, bye. You're not going home.

1166
01:37:40.328 --> 01:37:42.516
Yeah, well if we don't try...

1167
01:37:42.573 --> 01:37:44.360
then no one else is
going home, either.

1168
01:37:44.385 --> 01:37:45.540
I got it.

1169
01:37:45.938 --> 01:37:50.297
There's another way. To retake the
Tesseract and acquire new particles.

1170
01:37:51.071 --> 01:37:54.868
We'll stroll down memory lane.
Military installation, Garden State.

1171
01:37:58.539 --> 01:37:59.929
Why were they both there?

1172
01:37:59.954 --> 01:38:03.164
They were there at a...I've
a vaguely exact idea.

1173
01:38:03.188 --> 01:38:03.984
How vague?

1174
01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.438
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?

1175
01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:06.666
- I know for a fact they were there...
- Who's they?

1176
01:38:06.689 --> 01:38:09.414
- What are we doing?
- And I know how I know.

1177
01:38:10.312 --> 01:38:12.374
Guys, what's up? What is it?

1178
01:38:12.539 --> 01:38:14.326
Well, it looks like
we're improvising.

1179
01:38:14.351 --> 01:38:15.849
- Right.
- What are we improvising?

1180
01:38:15.874 --> 01:38:17.968
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1181
01:38:17.993 --> 01:38:18.703
Suit up.

1182
01:38:18.735 --> 01:38:19.882
What's in New Jersey?

1183
01:38:19.907 --> 01:38:21.781
- 0-4, 0-4...
- Uhh, 0-7.

1184
01:38:21.806 --> 01:38:22.875
- 0-7.
- Excuse me...

1185
01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.384
1-9-7-0.

1186
01:38:24.939 --> 01:38:29.290
- Are you sure?
- Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry.

1187
01:38:29.654 --> 01:38:32.552
America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this,

1188
01:38:32.587 --> 01:38:35.602
and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1189
01:38:36.446 --> 01:38:38.646
Thanks for the pep
talk, pissant.

1190
01:38:39.259 --> 01:38:40.524
You trust me?

1191
01:38:41.039 --> 01:38:42.165
I do.

1192
01:38:43.642 --> 01:38:44.899
Your call.

1193
01:38:45.813 --> 01:38:47.188
Here we go.

1194
01:39:03.329 --> 01:39:04.775
Hey, man!

1195
01:39:05.075 --> 01:39:06.605
Make love, not war!

1196
01:39:13.284 --> 01:39:15.926
Clearly, you weren't
actually born here, right?

1197
01:39:15.951 --> 01:39:17.565
The idea of me was.

1198
01:39:18.315 --> 01:39:20.877
Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a

1199
01:39:20.902 --> 01:39:23.791
quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization.

1200
01:39:24.839 --> 01:39:25.978
Where do you hide it?

1201
01:39:26.438 --> 01:39:27.651
In plain sight.

1202
01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:58.097
Good luck on your
mission, Captain.

1203
01:39:58.122 --> 01:40:00.365
Good luck on your
project, doctor.

1204
01:40:04.022 --> 01:40:05.365
You're new here?

1205
01:40:07.584 --> 01:40:08.787
Not exactly.

1206
01:40:24.258 --> 01:40:25.468
Gotcha.

1207
01:40:43.275 --> 01:40:44.658
Back in the game.

1208
01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:49.424
Arnim, you in there?

1209
01:40:49.736 --> 01:40:50.884
Arnim?

1210
01:40:56.111 --> 01:40:57.111
Hey!

1211
01:40:57.486 --> 01:40:59.407
The door's this way, pal.

1212
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:01.525
Oh, yeah.

1213
01:41:01.792 --> 01:41:03.564
I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?

1214
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:07.424
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,
I haven't seen a soul.

1215
01:41:08.653 --> 01:41:09.840
Pardon me.

1216
01:41:10.754 --> 01:41:12.254
Do I know you?

1217
01:41:13.699 --> 01:41:15.745
No, sir. I'm, a...

1218
01:41:16.168 --> 01:41:17.660
visitor from MIT.

1219
01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.519
Huh. MIT.

1220
01:41:20.128 --> 01:41:21.433
Got a name?

1221
01:41:21.824 --> 01:41:22.887
Howard.

1222
01:41:22.912 --> 01:41:24.527
Well that'll be
easy to remember.

1223
01:41:24.543 --> 01:41:26.019
Howard...

1224
01:41:26.683 --> 01:41:27.894
...Potts.

1225
01:41:27.919 --> 01:41:29.878
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1226
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:31.347
Hi.

1227
01:41:31.355 --> 01:41:32.690
Shit. Now, don't pull it.

1228
01:41:32.746 --> 01:41:33.746
Yeah...

1229
01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:37.605
You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.

1230
01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.534
I'm fine. Just, long hours.

1231
01:41:40.066 --> 01:41:41.761
Wanna get some ai
